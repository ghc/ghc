# This script can be used to generate some unregisterised .hc files
# for bootstrapping GHC on a new/unsupported platform.  It involves a
# two-stage bootstrap: the first stage builds an unregisterised set of
# libraries & RTS, and the second stage builds an unregisterised
# compiler.  

# Take the .hc files from the libraries of stage 1, and the compiler
# of stage 2, to the target system and bootstrap from these to get a
# working (unregisterised) compiler.
