This is the INSTALL instructions for a binary distribution of GHC. For
more details on what on earth this package is up to, please consult
the README and ANNOUNCE.

This distribution can either be installed in a location of your
choosing, or it can be used directly in-place (but it needs to be set
up first, read on).

To set the ball rolling, run the configure script (as usual, run the
script with --help to see what options it supports).  eg. to set up
the package for installing in directory <my-dir>, use

	./configure --prefix=<my-dir>

The default installation directory is /usr/local.  To use GHC
in-place, the --prefix option can be omitted.

The configure script will figure out what platform you're running on,
and a couple of other interesting pieces of trivia, which it will then
fill in the Makefile.in template to give you a real Makefile.  If
you're of a paranoid persuasion, you might want to take a look at this
Makefile to see if the information is correct.

To use the software in-place, now run:

	make in-place

or if you're installing,  run

	make install 

(`make show-install-setup' prints the details of where the different
pieces of the bundle are heading when -- possibly helpful).

For more information, full GHC documentation is available from the
main GHC site:

Bug reports/suggestions for improvement to the installation
procedure/setup (as well as other GHC related troubles you're
experiencing, of course), gratefully received.  Bug reporting
instructions are here:

Enjoy,
