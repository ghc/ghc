T17541b.hs:8:20: error:
    • Expected kind ‘k’, but ‘Int’ has kind ‘*’
    • In the second argument of ‘T’, namely ‘Int’
      In the type ‘T Type Int’
      In the definition of data constructor ‘MkT1’
      NB: Type ‘T’ was inferred to use visible dependent quantification.
      Most types with visible dependent quantification are
      polymorphically recursive and need a standalone kind
      signature. Perhaps supply one, with StandaloneKindSignatures.
