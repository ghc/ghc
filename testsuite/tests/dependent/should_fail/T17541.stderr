T17541.hs:20:17: error:
    • Expected kind ‘TYPE (Rep rep)’,
        but ‘Int#’ has kind ‘TYPE 'IntRep’
    • In the type ‘Int#’
      In the type family declaration for ‘Unboxed’
      NB: Type ‘Unboxed’ was inferred to use visible dependent quantification.
      Most types with visible dependent quantification are
      polymorphically recursive and need a standalone kind
      signature. Perhaps supply one, with StandaloneKindSignatures.
