    • Couldn't match type ‘m’ with ‘'Many’
      Expected: a %m -> b
        Actual: a -> b
      ‘m’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: forall a b (m :: GHC.Types.Multiplicity). a %m -> b
        at LinearVar.hs:4:1-14
    • In the expression: undefined :: a -> b
      In an equation for ‘f’: f = undefined :: a -> b
    • Relevant bindings include
        f :: a %m -> b (bound at LinearVar.hs:5:1)
