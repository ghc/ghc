T7594.hs:33:12: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘b0’ with ‘IO ()’
      ‘b0’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: (:&:) c0 Real a
        bound by a type expected by the context: (:&:) c0 Real a => a -> b0
        at T7594.hs:33:8-19
    ‘b0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of bar2 :: b0 at T7594.hs:33:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘bar2’
    Expected type: a -> b0
      Actual type: a -> IO ()
    Relevant bindings include bar2 :: b0 (bound at T7594.hs:33:1)
    In the first argument of ‘app’, namely ‘print’
    In the expression: app print q2
