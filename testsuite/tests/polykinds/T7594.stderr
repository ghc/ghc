    Couldn't match type ‛b’ with ‛IO ()’
      ‛b’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints ((:&:) Show Real a)
        bound by a type expected by the context:
                   (:&:) Show Real a => a -> b
        at T7594.hs:25:7-17
      ‛b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of bar :: b at T7594.hs:25:1
    Expected type: a -> b
      Actual type: a -> IO ()
    Relevant bindings include bar :: b (bound at T7594.hs:25:1)
    In the first argument of ‛app’, namely ‛print’
    In the expression: app print q
    In an equation for ‛bar’: bar = app print q
