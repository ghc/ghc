    Couldn't match expected type ‘t1’ with actual type ‘t’
      ‘t’ is untouchable

      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of go :: Thrist t2 t3 -> t -> t1 at T7438.hs:6:1
      ‘t1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of go :: Thrist t2 t3 -> t -> t1 at T7438.hs:6:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘go’
    Relevant bindings include
      acc :: t (bound at T7438.hs:6:8)
      go :: Thrist t2 t3 -> t -> t1 (bound at T7438.hs:6:1)
    In the expression: acc
    In an equation for ‘go’: go Nil acc = acc
