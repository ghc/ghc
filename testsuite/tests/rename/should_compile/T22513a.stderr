T22513a.hs:5:6: warning: [GHC-54201] [-Wterm-variable-capture]
    The type variable ‘a’ is implicitly quantified,
    even though another variable of the same name is in scope:
      ‘a’ defined at T22513a.hs:3:1
    This is not forward-compatible with a planned GHC extension, RequiredTypeArguments.
    Suggested fix: Consider renaming the type variable.
