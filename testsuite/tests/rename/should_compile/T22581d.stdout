<interactive>:2:30: error: [GHC-51433]
    In the import of ‘Data.Functor.Product’:
      a data type called ‘Product’ is exported,
      but its subordinate item ‘Pair’ is not in the type namespace.
    Suggested fix:
      Remove the ‘type’ keyword from the subordinate import item:
        import Data.Functor.Product ( Product ( Pair ) )
