T22513g.hs:5:1: warning: [GHC-54201] [-Wterm-variable-capture]
    The type variable ‘head’ is implicitly quantified,
    even though another variable of the same name is in scope:
      ‘head’ imported from ‘Prelude’
             (and originally defined in ‘GHC.Internal.List’)
    This is not compatible with the RequiredTypeArguments extension.
    Suggested fix: Consider renaming the type variable.
