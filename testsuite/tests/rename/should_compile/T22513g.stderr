T22513g.hs:5:15: warning: [GHC-54201] [-Wterm-variable-capture]
    The type variable ‘head’ is implicitly quantified,
    even though another variable of the same name is in scope:
      ‘head’ imported from ‘Prelude’ at T22513g.hs:2:8-14
             (and originally defined in ‘GHC.List’)
    This is not forward-compatible with a planned GHC extension, RequiredTypeArguments.
    Suggested fix: Consider renaming the type variable.
