T25991b2.hs:7:11: error: [GHC-01928]
    • Data constructor out of scope: ‘#’.
      NB: the type constructor ‘#’ cannot appear in this position.
    • In the expression: a # b
      In an equation for ‘f’: f a b = a # b
    Suggested fix:
      Add ‘#’ to the import list in the import of ‘T25991b_helper’
      (at T25991b2.hs:5:1-35).
