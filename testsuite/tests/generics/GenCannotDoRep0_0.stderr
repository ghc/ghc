    -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

GenCannotDoRep0_0.hs:13:45: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Generic Dynamic’:
        Constructor ‘Dynamic’ has existential type variables in its type
    • In the data declaration for ‘Dynamic’
    Suggested fix: Use a standalone deriving declaration instead

    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Generic (D Int a)’:
        D must not have a datatype context
