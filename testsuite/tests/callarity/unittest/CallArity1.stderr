nested_go2:
    go 2
    go2 2
    d 1
    n 1
d0 (go 2 would be bad):
    go 1
    d 0
go2 (in case crut):
    go 2
    d 1
go2 (in function call):
    go 2
    d 1
go2 (using surrounding interesting let):
    go 2
    d 1
    n 1
go2 (using surrounding boring let):
    go 2
    d 1
    z 0
two calls, one from let and from body (d 1 would be bad):
    go 2
    d 0
a thunk in a recursion (d 1 would be bad):
    d 0
    n 0
two thunks, one called multiple times (both arity 1 would be bad!):
    d 0
    n 1
two functions, not thunks:
    go 2
    go2 2
a thunk, called multiple times via a forking recursion (d 1 would be bad!):
    go2 2
    d 0
a function, one called multiple times via a forking recursion:
    go 2
    go2 2
two functions (recursive):
    go 2
    go2 2
mutual recursion (thunks), called mutiple times (both arity 1 would be bad!):
    d 0
    n 0
mutual recursion (functions), but no thunks:
    go 2
    go2 2
mutual recursion (functions), one boring (d 1 would be bad):
    go 2
    go2 2
    d 0
a thunk (non-function-type), called twice, still calls once:
    x 0
    d 1
a thunk (function type), called multiple times, still calls once:
    d 1
    n 0
a thunk (non-function-type), in mutual recursion, still calls once (d 1 would be good):
    go 2
    x 0
    d 1
a thunk (function type), in mutual recursion, still calls once (d 1 would be good):
    go 1
    d 1
    n 0
a thunk (non-function-type) co-calls with the body (d 1 would be bad):
    x 0
    d 0
