T14561b.hs:12:9: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of ‘coerce’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        b0 :: TYPE k0
      When unifying:
        • b0 -> b0
        • a -> a
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘k0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: coerce
      In an equation for ‘badId’: badId = coerce
