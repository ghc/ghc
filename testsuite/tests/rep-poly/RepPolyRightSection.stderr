RepPolyRightSection.hs:14:11: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The third argument of ‘rightSection’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a :: TYPE q0
      When unifying:
        • TYPE r
        • *
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘q0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: `g` undefined
      In an equation for ‘test2’: test2 = (`g` undefined)
