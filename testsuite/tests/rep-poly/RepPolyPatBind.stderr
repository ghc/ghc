    • The pattern binding does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        p0 :: TYPE c0
      When unifying:
        • (# a, a #)
        • p0
      Cannot unify ‘TupleRep [rep, rep]’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the pattern: (# x, y #)
