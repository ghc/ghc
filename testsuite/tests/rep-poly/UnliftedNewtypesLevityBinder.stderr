    • The newtype constructor argument
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: IdentC
      In an equation for ‘bad’: bad = IdentC
    • Relevant bindings include
        bad :: a -> Ident a (bound at UnliftedNewtypesLevityBinder.hs:15:1)
