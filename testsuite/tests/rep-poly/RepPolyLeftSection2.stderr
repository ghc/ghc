RepPolyLeftSection2.hs:14:11: error:
    • The argument ‘undefined’ of ‘f’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: undefined `f`
      In an equation for ‘test1’: test1 = (undefined `f`)
    • Relevant bindings include
        test1 :: a -> a (bound at RepPolyLeftSection2.hs:14:1)
