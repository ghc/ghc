T14561.hs:16:9: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of ‘unsafeCoerce#’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE q0
      When unifying:
        • a0 -> a
        • a -> a
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘q0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: unsafeCoerce#
      In an equation for ‘badId’: badId = unsafeCoerce#
