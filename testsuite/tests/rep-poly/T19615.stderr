T19615.hs:17:21: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The argument ‘(f x)’ of ‘lift'’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE r0
      When unifying:
        • b
        • a0
      Cannot unify ‘r'’ with the type variable ‘r0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the first argument of ‘lift'’, namely ‘(f x)’
      In the expression: lift' (f x) id
      In an equation for ‘mapF’: mapF f x = lift' (f x) id
