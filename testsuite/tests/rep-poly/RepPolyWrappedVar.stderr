RepPolyWrappedVar.hs:15:19: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of the primop ‘mkWeak#’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a1 :: TYPE (BoxedRep l0)
      When unifying:
        • TYPE (BoxedRep l)
        • *
      Cannot unify ‘l’ with the type variable ‘l0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘Levity’.
    • In the type ‘a’
      In the expression: mkWeak# @a @Int @Bool
      In an equation for ‘primop’: primop = mkWeak# @a @Int @Bool
