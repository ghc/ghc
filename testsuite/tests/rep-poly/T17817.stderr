T17817.hs:16:10: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of the primop ‘mkWeak#’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE (BoxedRep l0)
      When unifying:
        • a0
          -> b
          -> (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, c #))
          -> State# RealWorld
          -> (# State# RealWorld, Weak# b #)
        • a
          -> b
          -> (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, c #))
          -> State# RealWorld
          -> (# State# RealWorld, Weak# b #)
      Cannot unify ‘l’ with the type variable ‘l0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘Levity’.
    • In the expression: mkWeak#
      In an equation for ‘primop’: primop = mkWeak#
