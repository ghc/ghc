-- This module should run fine with an empty argument list
-- But it won't if the strictness analyser thinks that 'len' is used
-- strictly, which was the case in GHC 6.0

-- See Note [Precise exceptions and strictness analysis] in Demand.hs
-- This is similar to T17676, but with an extra putStrLn.
