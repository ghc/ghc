T24159_viewpat.hs:8:5: warning: [GHC-00834] [-Wview-pattern-signatures (in -Wdefault)]
    Found an unparenthesized pattern signature on the RHS of a view pattern.
    This code might stop working in a future GHC release
    due to a planned change to the precedence of view patterns,
    unless the view function is an endofunction.
      Current parse: ‘isJust -> (True :: Bool)’
      Future parse: ‘(isJust -> True) :: Bool’
    Suggested fix: Parenthesize the RHS of the view pattern
