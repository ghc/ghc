<interactive>:4:4: error: [GHC-31244]
    • Unexpected keyword ‘type’
    • In the untyped splice: $(typeE [t| Int |])
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘ExplicitNamespaces’ extension (implied by ‘TypeFamilies’ and ‘TypeOperators’)
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XExplicitNamespaces
