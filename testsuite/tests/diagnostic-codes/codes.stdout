- All non-outdated 'GhcDiagnosticCode' equations are statically used.

- All outdated 'GhcDiagnosticCode' equations are statically unused.

- The following diagnostic codes seem to not be covered by any tests,
  as determined by analysing all '.stderr' and '.stdout' files in the testsuite.
  If there is a change in the expected output of this test, you can:
    - add test cases to exercise any newly uncovered diagnostic codes,
    - accept the expected output of the 'codes' test by passing the '-a' flag to Hadrian.
