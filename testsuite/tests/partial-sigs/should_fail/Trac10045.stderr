    To use the inferred type, enable PartialTypeSignatures
    Relevant bindings include
      ws1 :: () (bound at Trac10045.hs:5:11)
      foo :: Meta -> t (bound at Trac10045.hs:5:1)
    In the type signature for ‘copy’: _
    In the expression:
      let
        copy :: _
        copy w from = copy w 1
      in copy ws1 1
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo (Meta ws1)
          = let
              copy :: _
              copy w from = copy w 1

Trac10045.hs:7:9:
    No instance for (Num a)
    When checking that ‘copy’ has the inferred type
      copy :: forall t t1 a. t -> a -> t1
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In the expression:
      let
        copy :: _
        copy w from = copy w 1
      in copy ws1 1
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo (Meta ws1)

              copy :: _
              copy w from = copy w 1
