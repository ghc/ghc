    • Could not deduce (Eq w0)
        arising from a type ambiguity check for
        the inferred type for ‘foo’
      from the context: (Show a, Eq w, Eq a)
        bound by the inferred type for ‘foo’:

      The type variable ‘w0’ is ambiguous
      These potential instances exist:
        instance Eq Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
        instance Eq a => Eq (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Maybe’
        instance Eq Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num.Integer’
        ...plus 23 others
        ...plus six instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the ambiguity check for the inferred type for ‘foo’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      When checking the inferred type
        foo :: forall {a} {w}. (Show a, Eq w, Eq a) => a -> a -> String
