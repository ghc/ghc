    • No instance for ‘Functor f’ arising from a use of ‘fmap’
      Possible fix:
        add (Functor f) to the context of
          the inferred type of h2 :: (a1 -> a2) -> f a1 -> H f
    • In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘fmap (const ())’
      In the expression: (H . fmap (const ())) (fmap f b)
      In an equation for ‘h2’: h2 f b = (H . fmap (const ())) (fmap f b)
