    Couldn't match expected type `p a' against inferred type `F ()'
      NB: `F' is a type function, and may not be injective
    In the first argument of `foo', namely `(undefined :: F ())'
    In the expression: foo (undefined :: F ())
    In the definition of `bar': bar = foo (undefined :: F ())
