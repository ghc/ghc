    Couldn't match type `e' with `e1'
      `e' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `foldr1' at FD2.hs:21:20
      `e1' is a rigid type variable bound by
           the type signature for `mf' at FD2.hs:24:25
    In the first argument of `Just', namely `(f x y)'
    In the expression: Just (f x y)
    In an equation for `mf': mf x (Just y) = Just (f x y)
