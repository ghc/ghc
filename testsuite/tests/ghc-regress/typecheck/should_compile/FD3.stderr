FD3.hs:15:15:
    Couldn't match type `a' with `(String, a)'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `translate' at FD3.hs:14:23
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      MkA a a,
        arising from the dependency `a -> b'
        in the instance declaration at FD3.hs:12:10
      MkA (String, a) a, arising from a use of `mkA' at FD3.hs:15:15-17
    In the expression: mkA a
    In an equation for `translate': translate a = mkA a

FD3.hs:15:15:
    No instance for (MkA (String, a1) a1)
      arising from a use of `mkA'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (MkA (String, a1) a1)
    In the expression: mkA a
    In an equation for `translate': translate a = mkA a
