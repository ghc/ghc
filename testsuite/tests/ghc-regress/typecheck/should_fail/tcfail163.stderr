    Generic method type is too complex
	match :: forall k.

	You can only use type variables, arrows, lists, and tuples
    When checking the class method:
      match :: k
	       -> z
	       -> (forall a b z. a -> b -> z)
	       -> (forall a z. a -> z)
	       -> (forall a z. a -> z)
	       -> z
