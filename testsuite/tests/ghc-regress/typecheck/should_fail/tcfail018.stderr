tcfail018.hs:5:9:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      `Num [a]' arising from the literal `1' at tcfail018.hs:5:9
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      a :: a (bound at tcfail018.hs:5:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
		  or use -fno-monomorphism-restriction
