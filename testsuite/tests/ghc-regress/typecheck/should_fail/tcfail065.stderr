    Couldn't match expected type `x' (a rigid variable)
	   against inferred type `x1' (a rigid variable)
      `x' is bound by the instance declaration at tcfail065.hs:28:17
      `x1' is bound by the type signature for `setX'
	at tcfail065.hs:25:10
    In the first argument of `X', namely `x'
    In the expression: X x
    In the definition of `setX': setX x (X _) = X x
