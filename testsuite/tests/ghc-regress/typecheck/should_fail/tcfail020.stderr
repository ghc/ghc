tcfail020.hs:10:0:
    Could not deduce (A [a]) from the context (A a)
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration at tcfail020.hs:10:0
    Possible fix:
      add (A [a]) to the instance declaration superclass context
      or add an instance declaration for (A [a])
    In the instance declaration for `B [a]'
