tcfail133.hs:67:13:
    No instance for (AddDigit ((:@) Zero ((:@) One One)) One a)
      arising from use of `add' at tcfail133.hs:67:13-38
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for
      (AddDigit ((:@) Zero ((:@) One One)) One a)
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
	`add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)'
    In the expression: show $ (add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One))
    In the definition of `foo':
	foo = show $ (add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One))
