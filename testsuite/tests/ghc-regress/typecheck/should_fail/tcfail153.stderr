    Couldn't match expected type `Bool'
	   against inferred type `a' (a rigid variable)
      `a' is bound by the type signature for `f' at tcfail153.hs:5:5
    In the first argument of `g', namely `x'
    In the expression: g x
    In the definition of `f':
	f x = g x
	    where
		g y = if y then [] else [y]
