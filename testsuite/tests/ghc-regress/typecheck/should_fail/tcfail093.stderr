tcfail093.hs:14:9:
    No instance for (Call (IO Int) h)
      arising from use of `call' at tcfail093.hs:14:9-20
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Call (IO Int) h)
    In the call (call primDup)
    In the expression: call primDup
    In the definition of `dup': dup () = call primDup
