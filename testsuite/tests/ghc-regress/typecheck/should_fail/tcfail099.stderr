    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
      Quantified type variable `a' is mentioned in the environment:
	call :: DS -> a -> Int (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:0)
    When checking an existential match that binds
	f :: a -> Int
    The pattern(s) have type(s): DS
				 a
    The body has type: Int
    In the definition of `call': call (C f) arg = f arg
