drvfail011.hs:5:5:
    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context (Eq (T a))
      arising from a use of `==' at drvfail011.hs:5:5
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for `=='
    In the expression: ((a1 == b1))
    In the definition of `==': == (T1 a1) (T1 b1) = ((a1 == b1))
    In the definition for method `=='
