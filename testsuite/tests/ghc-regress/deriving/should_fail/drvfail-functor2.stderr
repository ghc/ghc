drvfail-functor2.hs:7:13:
    Can't make a derived instance of `Functor InFunctionArgument'
      (Constructor `InFunctionArgument' uses the type variable in a function argument)
    In the newtype declaration for `InFunctionArgument'

drvfail-functor2.hs:10:13:
    Can't make a derived instance of `Functor OnSecondArg'
      (Constructor `OnSecondArg' uses the type variable in an argument other than the last)

drvfail-functor2.hs:15:13:
    Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form `Functor (NoArguments ...)'
      Class `Functor' expects an argument of kind `* -> *'

drvfail-functor2.hs:20:13:
    Can't derive instances where the instance context mentions
    type variables that are not data type parameters
      Offending constraint: Eq a
    When deriving the instance for (Functor StupidConstraint)

drvfail-functor2.hs:26:13:
    No instance for (Functor NoFunctor)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at drvfail-functor2.hs:26:13-19
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Functor NoFunctor)
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Functor UseNoFunctor)
