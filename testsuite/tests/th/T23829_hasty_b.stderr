T23829_hasty_b.hs:8:42: error: [GHC-28914]
    • Stage error: ‘ty’ is bound at stage 2 but used at stage 1
      Hint: quoting [t| ty |] or an enclosing expression would allow the quotation to be used in an earlier stage
    • In the untyped splice: $ty
      In the Template Haskell quotation
        [t| forall (ty :: TypeQ). Proxy $ty |]
