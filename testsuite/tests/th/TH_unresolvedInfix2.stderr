    The operator ‛:+’ [infixl 6] of a section
        must have lower precedence than that of the operand,
          namely ‛:+’ [infixl 6]
        in the section: ‛:+ N :+ N’
    In the result of the splice:
      $(let
          plus = conE ':+
          n = conE 'N
        in infixE Nothing plus (Just $ uInfixE n plus n))
    To see what the splice expanded to, use -ddump-splices
    In the expression:
      $(let
          plus = conE ...
          n = conE ...
        in infixE Nothing plus (Just $ uInfixE n plus n))
    In an equation for ‛expr’:
        expr
          = $(let
                plus = ...
                ....
              in infixE Nothing plus (Just $ uInfixE n plus n))
