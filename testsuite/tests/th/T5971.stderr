    The exact Name ‛x’ is not in scope
      Probable cause: you used a unique Template Haskell name (NameU), 
      perhaps via newName, but did not bind it
      If that's it, then -ddump-splices might be useful
    In the result of the splice:
      $(newName "x" >>= varE)
    To see what the splice expanded to, use -ddump-splices
    In the expression: $(newName "x" >>= varE)
