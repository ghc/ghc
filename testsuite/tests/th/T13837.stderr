    • The exact Name ‘Fam’ is not in scope
        Probable cause: you used a unique Template Haskell name (NameU), 
        perhaps via newName, but did not bind it
        If that's it, then -ddump-splices might be useful
    • In the argument of reifyInstances: Fam_0
      In the untyped splice:
        $(do fam_name <- newName "Fam"
             stringE . show =<< qReifyInstances fam_name [])
