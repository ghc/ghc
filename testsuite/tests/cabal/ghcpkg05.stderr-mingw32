  Warning: library-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  Warning: include-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  import-dirs: /usr/local/lib/testpkg is a relative path which makes no sense (as there is nothing for it to be relative to). You can make paths relative to the package database itself by using ${pkgroot}.
