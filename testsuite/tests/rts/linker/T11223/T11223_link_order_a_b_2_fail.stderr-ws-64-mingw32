GHC runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   a
whilst processing object file
   E:\ghc-dev\msys64\home\Tamar\ghc\testsuite\tests\rts\T11223\T11223_link_order_a_b_2_fail.run\libfoo_link_lib_3.a
The symbol was previously defined in
   E:\ghc-dev\msys64\home\Tamar\ghc\testsuite\tests\rts\T11223\T11223_link_order_a_b_2_fail.run\libbar_link_lib_3.a(#2:bar_link_lib_3.o)
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
ghc-stage2.exe: ^^ Could not load 'c', dependency unresolved. See top entry above. You might consider using --optimistic-linking


GHC.ByteCode.Linker: can't find label
During interactive linking, GHCi couldn't find the following symbol:
  c
This may be due to you not asking GHCi to load extra object files,
archives or DLLs needed by your current session.  Restart GHCi, specifying
the missing library using the -L/path/to/object/dir and -lmissinglibname
flags, or simply by naming the relevant files on the GHCi command line.
Alternatively, this link failure might indicate a bug in GHCi.
If you suspect the latter, please report this as a GHC bug:
