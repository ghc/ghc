SafeLang10.hs:8:13:
    Unsafe overlapping instances for Pos [Int]
      arising from a use of ‛res’
    The matching instance is:
      instance [overlap ok] [safe] Pos [Int]
        -- Defined at SafeLang10_B.hs:14:10
    It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
    overlap instances from the same module, however it
    overlaps the following instances from different modules:
      instance Pos [a] -- Defined at SafeLang10_A.hs:13:10
    In the expression: res [(1 :: Int)]
    In an equation for ‛r’: r = res [(1 :: Int)]
    In the expression:
      do { let r = res ...;
           putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show r;
           putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show function }
