    -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving is not allowed in Safe Haskell; ignoring -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving

<interactive>:16:29: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Op T2’:
        ‘Op’ is not a stock derivable class (Eq, Show, etc.)
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘T2’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
      for GHC's newtype-deriving extension

<interactive>:19:9: error:
    Data constructor not in scope: T2 :: T -> t
    Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘T1’ (line 13)

<interactive>:22:4: error: Variable not in scope: y
