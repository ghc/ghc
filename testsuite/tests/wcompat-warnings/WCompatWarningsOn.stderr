    • Could not deduce (Control.Monad.Fail.MonadFail m)
        arising from the failable pattern ‘Just _’
        (this will become an error in a future GHC release)
      from the context: Monad m
        bound by the type signature for:
                   monadFail :: forall (m :: * -> *) a. Monad m => m a
        at Template.hs:7:1-27
      Possible fix:
        add (Control.Monad.Fail.MonadFail m) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            monadFail :: forall (m :: * -> *) a. Monad m => m a
    • In a stmt of a 'do' block: Just _ <- undefined
      In the expression:
        do Just _ <- undefined
           undefined
      In an equation for ‘monadFail’:
          monadFail
            = do Just _ <- undefined
                 undefined
