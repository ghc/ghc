Template.hs:9:29: warning: [GHC-16382] [-Wimplicit-rhs-quantification (in -Wcompat)]
    The variable ‘a’ occurs free on the RHS of the type declaration
    In the future GHC will no longer implicitly quantify over such variables
    Suggested fix: Bind ‘a’ on the LHS of the type declaration

Template.hs:12:6: warning: [GHC-69797] [-Wdeprecated-type-abstractions (in -Wcompat)]
    Type applications in constructor patterns will require
    the TypeAbstractions extension starting from GHC 9.14.
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TypeAbstractions’ extension
