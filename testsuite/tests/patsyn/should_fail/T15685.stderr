    • Couldn't match kind ‘a1’ with ‘[k0]’
        ‘a1’ is untouchable
          inside the constraints: as ~ (a2 : as1)
          bound by a pattern with constructor:
                     Here :: forall {a1} (f :: a1 -> *) (a2 :: a1) (as :: [a1]).
                             f a2 -> NS f (a2 : as),
                   in a pattern synonym declaration
          at T15685.hs:13:19-26
      ‘a1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of HereNil :: NS f as
        at T15685.hs:13:9-15
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘HereNil’
      When matching types
        f :: a1 -> *
        NP a0 :: [k0] -> *
      Expected type: f a2
        Actual type: NP a0 b0
    • In the pattern: Nil
      In the pattern: Here Nil
      In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘HereNil’
