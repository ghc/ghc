    • Couldn't match expected type ‘[a0]’ with actual type ‘x’
      ‘x’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the signature for pattern synonym ‘P’ at T13441b.hs:12:1-19
    • In the first argument of ‘MkS’, namely ‘x’
      In the expression: MkS x
      In an equation for ‘P’: P x = MkS x
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: x (bound at T13441b.hs:12:19)
        $bP :: x -> S (bound at T13441b.hs:12:9)
