    • Couldn't match type: forall a. a -> a
                     with: Int -> Int
        arising from a functional dependency between constraints:
          ‘?poly::Int -> Int’
            arising from a use of implicit parameter ‘?poly’ at T20654a.hs:7:9-13
          ‘?poly::forall a. a -> a’
            arising from the type signature for:
                           foo :: (?poly::forall a. a -> a) => Int -> Int at T20654a.hs:6:1-48
    • In the expression: ?poly x
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo x = ?poly x
