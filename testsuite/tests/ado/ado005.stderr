    Could not deduce (Monad f) arising from a do statement
    from the context: Applicative f
      bound by the type signature for:
               test :: Applicative f => (Int -> f Int) -> f Int
      at ado005.hs:6:9-48
    Possible fix:
      add (Monad f) to the context of
        the type signature for:
        test :: Applicative f => (Int -> f Int) -> f Int
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: x <- f 3
    In the expression:
      do { x <- f 3;
           y <- f x;
           return (x + y) }
    In an equation for ‘test’:
        test f
          = do { x <- f 3;
                 y <- f x;
                 return (x + y) }
