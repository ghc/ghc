-- this test shows a limitiation of not using optimised code because the definition
-- of >> for the identity monad is in object code -- it means we never have a BCO
-- to return to as the statements are all evaluated as arguments to >>...

-- thus, this test is run twice. once with optimisations and once without
-- note: we test this twice, once with optimisations and once without (see T26042f1 vs T26042f2)
