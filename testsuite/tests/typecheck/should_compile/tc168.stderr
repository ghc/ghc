    Could not deduce (C a1 (a, b0))
      arising from the ambiguity check for ‛g’
    from the context (C a1 (a, b))
      bound by the inferred type for ‛g’: C a1 (a, b) => a1 -> a
      at tc168.hs:17:1-16
    The type variable ‛b0’ is ambiguous
    When checking that ‛g’
      has the inferred type ‛forall a b a1. C a1 (a, b) => a1 -> a’
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
