    Could not deduce (a ~ (Int -> Int))
    from the context (E a (Int -> Int))
      bound by the type signature for
                 plus :: E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
      at FD1.hs:15:9-38
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for plus :: E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
          at FD1.hs:15:9
    Relevant bindings include plus :: Int -> a (bound at FD1.hs:16:1)
    The equation(s) for ‛plus’ have two arguments,
    but its type ‛Int -> a’ has only one
