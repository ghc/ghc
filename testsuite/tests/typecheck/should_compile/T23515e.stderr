    • Couldn't match kind 't1' with 'GHC.Internal.Types.LiftedRep'
      Expected kind '*', but 'a' has kind 'TYPE t1'
      't1' is a rigid type variable bound by
        a family instance declaration
        at T23515e.hs:8:3-22
    • A type family requires additional information that could be derived from pattern matching on kinds
      Consider adding an explicit kind annotation: F ((a :: Type) -> _) = Maybe a
    • In the first argument of 'Maybe', namely 'a'
      In the type family declaration for 'F'
