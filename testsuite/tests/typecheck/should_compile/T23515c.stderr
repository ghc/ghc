    • Expected a type, but 'a' has kind 'k1'
      'k1' is a rigid type variable bound by
        a family instance declaration
        at T23515c.hs:8:3-16
    • A type family requires additional information that could be derived from pattern matching on kinds
      Consider adding an explicit kind annotation: N' (t (a :: Type)) = [a]
    • In the type family declaration for 'N''
