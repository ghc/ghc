    Variable not in scope: putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
    Suggested fixes:
      • Perhaps use one of these:
          ‘System.IO.putStrLn’ (imported from System.IO),
          ‘System.IO.putStr’ (imported from System.IO)
      • Remove ‘putStrLn’ from the explicit hiding list in the import of
        ‘Prelude’ (at valid_hole_fits.hs:3:1-40).
