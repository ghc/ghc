    Couldn't match type ‛a’ with ‛(String, a)’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for translate :: (String, a) -> A a
          at FD3.hs:14:14
    Relevant bindings include
      translate :: (String, a) -> A a (bound at FD3.hs:15:1)
      a :: (String, a) (bound at FD3.hs:15:11)
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      MkA a a,
        arising from the dependency ‛a -> b’
        in the instance declaration at FD3.hs:12:10
      MkA (String, a) a, arising from a use of ‛mkA’ at FD3.hs:15:15-17
    In the expression: mkA a
    In an equation for ‛translate’: translate a = mkA a
