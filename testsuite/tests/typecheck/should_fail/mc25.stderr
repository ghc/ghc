    No instance for (Functor t1) arising from a use of ‛fmap’
    Possible fix:
      add (Functor t1) to the context of
        a type expected by the context: (a -> b) -> t1 a -> t1 b
        or the inferred type of z :: [t1 t]
    In the expression: fmap
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group by x using take
    In the expression: [x | x <- [1 .. 10], then group by x using take]

    Couldn't match type ‛Int’ with ‛a -> t’
