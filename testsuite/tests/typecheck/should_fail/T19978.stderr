    • Illegal term-level use of the type constructor or class ‘Bool’
    • imported from ‘Prelude’ at T19978.hs:3:8-13

        ‘Bowl’ (line 11), variable ‘bool’ (line 12)
    • In the expression: Bool
      In an equation for ‘ex1’: ex1 = Bool

T19978.hs:14:7: error:
    Data constructor not in scope: Let
    Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘Left’ (imported from Prelude)

    • Illegal term-level use of the type variable ‘mytv’
    • bound at T19978.hs:20:15
