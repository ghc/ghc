T15850.hs:11:18: error: [GHC-18872]
    • Couldn't match type ‘LocalIdentity ()’ with ‘()’
        arising from a use of ‘coerce’
      • Note:
        • The data constructor ‘T15850_Lib.LibIdentity’
            of newtype ‘LibIdentity’ is not in scope.
        • The type constructor ‘LibIdentity’ has nominal role in its first argument.
    • In the expression: coerce
      In an equation for ‘difficultError’: difficultError = coerce
    Suggested fix:
      Add ‘LibIdentity’ to the import list in the import of ‘T15850_Lib’
      (at T15850.hs:5:1-31).
