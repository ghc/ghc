    • Could not deduce ‘Show (T c)’
        arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration

        bound by the instance declaration at T20666.hs:13:10-31
      Possible fix:
        If the constraint looks soluble from a superclass of the instance context,
        read 'Undecidable instances and loopy superclasses' in the user manual
    • In the instance declaration for ‘C1 c’
