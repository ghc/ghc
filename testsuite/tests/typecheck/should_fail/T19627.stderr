T19627.hs:108:3: error: [GHC-05617]
    • Could not deduce ‘Not (p0 a b) ~ Not (p a b)’
      from the context: Lol p
        bound by the type signature for:
                   apartR :: forall (p :: * -> * -> *) a b.
                             Lol p =>
                             Not (p a b) -> b <#- a
        at T19627.hs:108:3-34
      Expected: Not (p a b) -> b <#- a
        Actual: Not (p0 a b) -> b <#- a
      Note: ‘Not’ is a non-injective type family.
      The type variable ‘p0’ is ambiguous
    • In the ambiguity check for ‘apartR’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      When checking the class method:
        apartR :: forall (p :: * -> * -> *) a b.
                  Lol p =>
                  Not (p a b) -> b <#- a
      In the class declaration for ‘Lol’
