    Couldn't match type ‛Char’ with ‛[a]’
    Relevant bindings include
      bar :: KCC -> a -> a (bound at FDsFromGivens.hs:21:1)
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      C Char Char,
        arising from a pattern with constructor
                       KCC :: C Char Char => () -> KCC,

        at FDsFromGivens.hs:21:6-10
      C Char [a], arising from a use of ‛f’ at FDsFromGivens.hs:21:15
    In the expression: f
    In an equation for ‛bar’: bar (KCC _) = f
