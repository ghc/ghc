    Couldn't match type ‛a’ with ‛Bool’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for f :: a -> [a] at tcfail153.hs:5:6
    Expected type: [a]
      Actual type: [Bool]
    Relevant bindings include
      f :: a -> [a] (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:1)
      x :: a (bound at tcfail153.hs:6:3)
    In the expression: g x
    In an equation for ‛f’:
        f x
          = g x
          where
              g y = if y then [] else [...]
