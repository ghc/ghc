T23731b.hs:9:7: error: [GHC-18872]
    • Couldn't match type ‘Int’ with ‘Sum Int’
        arising from a use of ‘coerce’
      • Note:
        • The data constructor ‘T23731b_aux.MkFoo’
            of newtype ‘Foo’ is not in scope.
        • The type constructor ‘Foo’ has nominal role in its first argument.
    • In the expression: coerce
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = coerce
    Suggested fix:
      Add ‘MkFoo’ to the import list in the import of ‘T23731b_aux’
      (at T23731b.hs:3:1-24).
