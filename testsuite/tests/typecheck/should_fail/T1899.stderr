    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘Proposition a0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a
          at T1899.hs:9:14
    Relevant bindings include
      varSet :: [a] (bound at T1899.hs:10:11)
      transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a (bound at T1899.hs:10:2)
    In the first argument of ‘Prop’, namely ‘(Auxiliary undefined)’
    In the expression: Prop (Auxiliary undefined)
