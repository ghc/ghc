    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘HsDoc id0’
    ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
        gfoldl' :: (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)
                   -> (forall g. g -> c g) -> a -> c a
        at tcfail201.hs:15:12
    Relevant bindings include
      hsDoc :: a (bound at tcfail201.hs:16:13)
      gfoldl' :: (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)
                 -> (forall g. g -> c g) -> a -> c a
        (bound at tcfail201.hs:16:1)
    In the first argument of ‘z’, namely ‘DocEmpty’
    In the expression: z DocEmpty
    In a case alternative: DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
