    Couldn't match expected type ‛a’ with actual type ‛HsDoc t0’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for
            gfoldl' :: (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)
                       -> (forall g. g -> c g) -> a -> c a
          at tcfail201.hs:15:12
    Relevant bindings include
      hsDoc :: a (bound at tcfail201.hs:16:13)
      gfoldl' :: (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)
                 -> (forall g. g -> c g) -> a -> c a
        (bound at tcfail201.hs:16:1)
    In the pattern: DocEmpty
    In a case alternative: DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
    In the expression:
      case hsDoc of {
        DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
        (DocParagraph hsDoc) -> z DocParagraph `k` hsDoc }
