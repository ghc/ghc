    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘HsDoc id0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          gfoldl' :: forall (c :: * -> *) a.
                     (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)

        at tcfail201.hs:15:1-85
      Expected type: c a
        Actual type: c (HsDoc id0)
    • In the expression: z DocEmpty
      In a case alternative: DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
      In the expression: case hsDoc of DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
