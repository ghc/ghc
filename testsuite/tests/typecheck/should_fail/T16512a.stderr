    • Couldn't match type: ListVariadic as (a -> b)
                     with: a -> ListVariadic as b
      Expected: AST (ListVariadic (a : as) b)
        Actual: AST (ListVariadic as (a -> b))
    • In the first argument of ‘AnApplication’, namely ‘g’
      In the expression: AnApplication g (a `ConsAST` as)
