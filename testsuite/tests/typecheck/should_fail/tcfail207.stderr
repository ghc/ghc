    Couldn't match expected type ‛[Int] -> [Int]’
                with actual type ‛[a1]’
    Possible cause: ‛take’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take x []
    In an equation for ‛f’: f x = take x []

    Couldn't match expected type ‛[Int]’
                with actual type ‛[a0] -> [a0]’
    Probable cause: ‛take’ is applied to too few arguments
    In the expression: take 3
    In an equation for ‛g’: g = take 3
