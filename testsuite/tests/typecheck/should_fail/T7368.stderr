T7368.hs:3:10:
    Couldn't match kind ‛* -> *’ with ‛*’
    When matching types
      c0 :: (* -> *) -> *
      (->) a0 :: * -> *
    Expected type: a0 -> b0
      Actual type: c0 b1
    In the return type of a call of ‛l’
    Probable cause: ‛l’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the first argument of ‛b’, namely ‛(l ())’
    In the expression: b (l ())

T7368.hs:3:13:
    Couldn't match type ‛()’ with ‛b0 a1’
    Expected type: b1 a1
      Actual type: ()
    In the first argument of ‛l’, namely ‛()’
    In the first argument of ‛b’, namely ‛(l ())’
    In the expression: b (l ())
