    Couldn't match type ‛Bool’ with ‛Char’
    When using functional dependencies to combine
      C Double Bool,
        arising from the dependency ‛from -> to’
        in the instance declaration at T5978.hs:8:10
      C Double Char, arising from a use of ‛polyBar’ at T5978.hs:22:11-17
    In the expression: polyBar id monoFoo
    In an equation for ‛monoBar’: monoBar = polyBar id monoFoo
