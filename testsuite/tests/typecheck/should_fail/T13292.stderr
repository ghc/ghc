    • Ambiguous type variable ‘m0’ arising from a use of ‘return’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Monad m0)’ from being solved.
      Relevant bindings include
        someFunc :: m0 () (bound at T13292a.hs:4:1)
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘m0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Monad IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Base’
        instance Monad Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Base’
        ...plus six others
        ...plus one instance involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the expression: return ()
      In an equation for ‘someFunc’: someFunc = return ()
