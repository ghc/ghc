    • Couldn't match type ‘[a1]’ with ‘[a] -> [[a]]’
      Expected type: (a -> a0) -> [a] -> [[a]]
        Actual type: [a1] -> [a1]
    • Possible cause: ‘take’ is applied to too many arguments
      In the expression: take 2
      In a stmt of a list comprehension: then group by x using take 2
      In the expression:
        [length x | x <- [1 .. 10], then group by x using take 2]
