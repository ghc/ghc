T9305.hs:8:48:
    No instance for (Functor Event)
      arising from the first field of ‘EventF’ (type ‘F (Event a)’)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Functor EventF)
