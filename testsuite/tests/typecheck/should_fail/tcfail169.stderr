tcfail169.hs:7:51:
    No instance for (Show (Succ a))
      arising from the second field of ‘Cons’ (type ‘Seq (Succ a)’)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Show (Seq a))
