FDsFromGivens2.hs:14:15: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[a0]’
      arising from a functional dependency between constraints:
        ‘C Char [a0]’ arising from a use of ‘f’ at FDsFromGivens2.hs:14:15
        ‘C Char Char’
          arising from a pattern with constructor:
                         KCC :: C Char Char => () -> KCC,
                       in an equation for ‘bar’
          at FDsFromGivens2.hs:14:6-10
    Relevant bindings include
      bar :: KCC -> a0 -> a0 (bound at FDsFromGivens2.hs:14:1)
    In the expression: f
    In an equation for ‘bar’: bar (KCC _) = f
