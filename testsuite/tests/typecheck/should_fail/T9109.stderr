    Couldn't match expected type ‘t’ with actual type ‘Bool’
      ‘t’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints (t1 ~ Bool)
        bound by a pattern with constructor: GBool :: G Bool,
                 in an equation for ‘foo’
        at T9109.hs:8:5-9
      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of foo :: G t1 -> t at T9109.hs:8:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘foo’
    Relevant bindings include foo :: G t1 -> t (bound at T9109.hs:8:1)
    In the expression: True
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo GBool = True
