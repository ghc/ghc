T9109.hs:8:13: error:
    • Could not deduce (p ~ Bool)
      from the context: a ~ Bool
        bound by a pattern with constructor: GBool :: G Bool,
                 in an equation for ‘foo’
        at T9109.hs:8:5-9
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of foo :: G a -> p
        at T9109.hs:8:1-16
    • In the expression: True
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo GBool = True
    • Relevant bindings include foo :: G a -> p (bound at T9109.hs:8:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘foo’ a type signature
