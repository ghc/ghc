     Couldn't match type ‘flds0’ with ‘flds’
      Expected: NP (K String) flds
        Actual: NP (K String) flds0
     ‘flds0’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: All flds0
        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   Record :: forall (xs :: [*]).

      ‘flds’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          fieldNames :: forall a (flds :: [*]). NP (K String) flds

     In the second argument of ‘hmap’, namely ‘np’
      In the expression: hmap id np
      In a case alternative: Record np -> hmap id np
     Relevant bindings include
        np :: NP (K String) flds0 (bound at T21338.hs:38:10)
