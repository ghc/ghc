    Could not deduce: Coercible a b
      arising from trying to show that the representations of
        ‘a’ and
        ‘b’ are the same
    from the context: Coercible (DF a) (DF b)
      bound by the type signature for:
               silly :: Coercible (DF a) (DF b) => a -> b
      at T10534a.hs:9:10-42
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for: silly :: Coercible (DF a) (DF b) => a -> b

      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for: silly :: Coercible (DF a) (DF b) => a -> b
          at T10534a.hs:9:10
    Relevant bindings include
      silly :: a -> b (bound at T10534a.hs:10:1)
    In the expression: coerce
    In an equation for ‘silly’: silly = coerce
