tcfail042.hs:17:18:
    Could not deduce (Num a) arising from a use of `foo'
    from the context (Eq a, Show a)
      bound by the instance declaration at tcfail042.hs:15:10-34
    Possible fix:
      add (Num a) to the context of the instance declaration
    In the expression: foo xs
    In an equation for `bar':
        bar (x : xs)
