    Couldn't match expected type ‛a1’ with actual type ‛a’
      because type variable ‛a1’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      an expression type signature: a1
      at tcfail198.hs:6:36-41
    Relevant bindings include
      xs :: [a] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:21)
      x :: a (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:19)
      f3 :: [a] -> [a] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:6)
    In the expression: x :: a
    In the second argument of ‛(++)’, namely ‛[x :: a]’
