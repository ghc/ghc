mc22.hs:8:11:
    No instance for (Num (t0 [Char])) arising from a use of `+'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num (t0 [Char]))
    In the expression: x + 1
    In the expression:
      [x + 1 | x <- ["Hello", "World"], then group using take 5]
    In an equation for `foo':
        foo = [x + 1 | x <- ["Hello", "World"], then group using take 5]

mc22.hs:10:9:
    No instance for (Functor t0) arising from a use of `fmap'
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
      instance Functor ((->) r) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
      instance Functor IO -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
      ...plus one other
    In the expression: fmap
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group using take 5
    In the expression:
      [x + 1 | x <- ["Hello", "World"], then group using take 5]

mc22.hs:10:26:
    Couldn't match type `a' with `t0 a'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: [a] -> [t0 a] at mc22.hs:10:9
    Expected type: [a] -> [t0 a]
      Actual type: [a] -> [a]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group using take 5
