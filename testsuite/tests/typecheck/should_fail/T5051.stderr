    Overlapping instances for Eq [a] arising from a use of ‛>=’
    Matching instances:
      instance Eq a => Eq [a] -- Defined in ‛GHC.Classes’
      instance [overlap ok] Eq [T] -- Defined at T5051.hs:8:10
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‛a’
     To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: x >= x
    In an equation for ‛foo’: foo x = x >= x
