    Cannot instantiate unification variable ‛b0’
    with a type involving foralls: forall b. (C A b, TF b ~ Y) => b
      Perhaps you want -XImpredicativeTypes
    In the expression: f :: (forall b. (C A b, TF b ~ Y) => b) -> X
    In the expression: (f :: (forall b. (C A b, TF b ~ Y) => b) -> X) u
    In an equation for ‛v’:
        v = (f :: (forall b. (C A b, TF b ~ Y) => b) -> X) u
