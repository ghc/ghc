    Couldn't match type ‛a’ with ‛(?p::Int) => a0’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: a -> String at T3102.hs:11:10
    Expected type: a -> String
      Actual type: ((?p::Int) => a0) -> String
    In the first argument of ‛f’, namely ‛t’
    In the expression: f t
