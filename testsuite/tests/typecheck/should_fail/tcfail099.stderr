    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘t0’
      because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      a pattern with constructor: C :: forall a. (a -> Int) -> DS,
      in an equation for ‘call’
      at tcfail099.hs:9:7-9
    Relevant bindings include
      arg :: t0 (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:12)
      f :: a -> Int (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:9)
      call :: DS -> t0 -> Int (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:1)
    In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘arg’
    In the expression: f arg
