    Couldn't match expected type ‛a’ with actual type ‛t’
      because type variable ‛a’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      a pattern with constructor
        C :: forall a. (a -> Int) -> DS,
      in an equation for ‛call’
      at tcfail099.hs:9:7-9
    Relevant bindings include

      f :: a -> Int (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:9)
      call :: DS -> t -> Int (bound at tcfail099.hs:9:1)
    In the first argument of ‛f’, namely ‛arg’
    In the expression: f arg
