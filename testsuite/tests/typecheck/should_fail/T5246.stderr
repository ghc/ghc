    • Couldn't match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Int’
        arising from a functional dependency between constraints:

          ‘?x::String’
            arising from the implicit-parameter binding for ?x at T5246.hs:(10,7)-(11,12)
    • In the expression: foo
      In the expression: let ?x = "hello" in foo
      In an equation for ‘bar’: bar = let ?x = "hello" in foo
