    • Could not deduce ‘p ~ GHC.Types.Bool’
      from the context: Nt String ~ Mt Int
        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   Refl :: forall {k} (a :: k). Eq a a,
                 in a case alternative
        at T24938.hs:28:5-8
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of foo :: p -> Eq (Mt Int) (Nt String) -> t
        at T24938.hs:(26,1)-(33,17)
    • In the expression: p
      In the expression: if p then useIntAndRaise x else use x
      In an equation for ‘bar’:
          bar x = if p then useIntAndRaise x else use x
    • Relevant bindings include
        p :: p (bound at T24938.hs:26:5)
        foo :: p -> Eq (Mt Int) (Nt String) -> t (bound at T24938.hs:26:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘foo’ a type signature
