    Couldn't match expected type ‛String -> String -> String’
                with actual type ‛a’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for evalRHS :: Int -> a at tcfail175.hs:10:12
    Relevant bindings include
      evalRHS :: Int -> a (bound at tcfail175.hs:11:1)
    The equation(s) for ‛evalRHS’ have three arguments,
    but its type ‛Int -> a’ has only one
