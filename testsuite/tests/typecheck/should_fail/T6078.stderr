    You can't mix polymorphic and unlifted bindings
      ip1p@(Ptr ip1) = Ptr ip0 `plusPtr` len
      Probable fix: use a bang pattern
    In the expression:
      let ip1p@(Ptr ip1) = Ptr ip0 `plusPtr` len in ip1p
    In the expression:
      \ fpbuf ip0 ipe s0 -> let ip1p@(Ptr ip1) = ... in ip1p
    In an equation for ‛byteStringSlice’:
        byteStringSlice len = \ fpbuf ip0 ipe s0 -> let ... in ip1p
