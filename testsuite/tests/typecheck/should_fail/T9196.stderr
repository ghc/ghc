    • Illegal polymorphic type: forall a1. Eq a1
      A constraint must be a monotype
    • In the type signature: f :: (forall a. Eq a) => a -> a
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘QuantifiedConstraints’ extension

    • Illegal qualified type: Eq a => Ord a
      A constraint must be a monotype
    • In the type signature: g :: (Eq a => Ord a) => a -> a
