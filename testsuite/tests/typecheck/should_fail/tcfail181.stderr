    Could not deduce (Monad m0) arising from a use of ‘foo’
    from the context (Monad m)
      bound by the inferred type of
               wog :: Monad m => t -> Something (m Bool) e
      at tcfail181.hs:17:1-30
    The type variable ‘m0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Monad ((->) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      instance Monad IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      instance Monad [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      ...plus one other
    In the expression: foo
    In the expression: foo {bar = return True}
    In an equation for ‘wog’: wog x = foo {bar = return True}
