tcfail133.hs:68:7: error:
    No instance for (Show a0) arising from a use of ‘show’
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      ...plus 25 others
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)

tcfail133.hs:68:14: error:

    In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely
      ‘add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)’
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
