    Could not deduce (Bar a0)
      arising from the ambiguity check for an instance declaration
    from the context (Bar a)
      bound by an instance declaration: Bar a => Bar Bool
      at tcfail098.hs:12:10-26
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    In the ambiguity check for: forall a. Bar a => Bar Bool
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the instance declaration for ‘Bar Bool’
