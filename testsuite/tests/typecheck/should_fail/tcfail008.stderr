    No instance for (Num a0) arising from the literal `1'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Relevant bindings include o :: [a0] (bound at tcfail008.hs:3:1)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Num Double -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Num Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Integral a => Num (GHC.Real.Ratio a)
        -- Defined in `GHC.Real'
      ...plus three others
    In the first argument of `(:)', namely `1'
    In the expression: 1 : 2
    In an equation for `o': o = 1 : 2
