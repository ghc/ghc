    Couldn't match expected type ‘forall a. Show a => a -> String’
                with actual type ‘b0 -> String’
    In the second argument of ‘putMVar’, namely
      ‘(show :: forall b. Show b => b -> String)’
    In a stmt of a 'do' block:
      putMVar var (show :: forall b. Show b => b -> String)
    In the expression:
      do { var <- newEmptyMVar ::
                    IO (MVar (forall a. Show a => a -> String));
           putMVar var (show :: forall b. Show b => b -> String) }
