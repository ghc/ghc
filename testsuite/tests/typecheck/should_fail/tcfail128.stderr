    • Ambiguous type variable ‘b0’ arising from a use of ‘thaw’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Data.Array.Base.MArray
                                  b0 FlatVector IO)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘b0’ should be.

    • In the expression: thaw tmp
      In the expression:

               ....
           v <- thaw tmp
