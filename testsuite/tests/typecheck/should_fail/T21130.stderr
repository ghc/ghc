    • Ambiguous type variable ‘t0’ arising from a use of ‘f’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Enum (Item t0))’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Enum Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Enum’
        instance Enum Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Enum’
        ...plus 8 others
        ...plus 9 instances involving out-of-scope types
