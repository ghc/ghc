 T21130.hs:10:8:
     Ambiguous type variable ‘t0’ arising from a use of ‘f’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Enum (Item t0))’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’ should be.
       Potentially matching instances:
        instance Enum Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Enum’
        instance Enum Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Enum’
         ...plus N others
         ...plus N instances involving out-of-scope types
         (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
     In the first argument of ‘_’, namely ‘f’
       In the expression: (_ f) :: Int
      In an equation for ‘x’: x = (_ f) :: Int
