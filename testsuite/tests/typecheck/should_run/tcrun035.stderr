    Couldn't match type `IO a'
                  with `forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a'
    Expected type: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
      Actual type: IO a -> IO a
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: (forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => m a) -> IO a
        (bound at tcrun035.hs:13:1)
    In the expression: id . id
    In an equation for `foo': foo = id . id
