T13838: Uncaught exception ghc-internal:GHC.Internal.Control.Exception.Base.TypeError:

T13838.hs:6:1: error: [GHC-83865]
    • Couldn't match expected type: IO t0
                  with actual type: () -> ()
    • Probable cause: ‘main’ is applied to too few arguments
      In the expression: main
      When checking the type of the IO action ‘main’
(deferred type error)
