T7861: T7861.hs:10:5: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘[a]’
    ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for: f :: (forall b. a) -> a at T7861.hs:9:6
    Expected type: (forall b. a) -> a
      Actual type: (forall b. a) -> [a]
    Relevant bindings include
      f :: (forall b. a) -> a (bound at T7861.hs:10:1)
    In the expression: doA
    In an equation for ‘f’: f = doA
(deferred type error)
