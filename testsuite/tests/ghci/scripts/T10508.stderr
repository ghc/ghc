<interactive>:1:15: error:
    • Couldn't match type: a0 -> a0
                     with: [Char]
      Expected: Prelude.String
        Actual: a0 -> a0
    • Probable cause: ‘id’ is applied to too few arguments
      In the first argument of ‘return’, namely ‘id’
      In the expression: return id
      In the second argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘(\ _ -> return id)’
unknown command ':macro'
use :? for help.
