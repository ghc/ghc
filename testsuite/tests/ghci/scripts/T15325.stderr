    • Ambiguous type variable ‘e0’ arising from the literal ‘0’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Num e0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘e0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Num Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Num’
        instance Num Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Float’
        ...plus three others
        ...plus one instance involving out-of-scope types
