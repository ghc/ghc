<interactive>:3:1: error:
    Variable not in scope: ll
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        ‘Ghci1.l’ (imported from Ghci1), ‘l’ (line 2),
        ‘all’ (imported from Prelude)

<no location info>: error:
    Could not find module ‘Ghci1’
    It is not a module in the current program, or in any known package.
