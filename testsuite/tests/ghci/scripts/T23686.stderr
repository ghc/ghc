T23686A.hs:4:1: error: [GHC-39191]
    • Illegal family declaration for ‘GMap’
    • In the data family declaration for ‘GMap’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TypeFamilies’ extension (implied by ‘TypeFamilyDependencies’)
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XTypeFamilies

T23686B.hs:5:5: error: [GHC-62558]
    • Syntax error on [| \ left right x -> left (right x) |]
    • In the Template Haskell quotation
        [| \ left right x -> left (right x) |]
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TemplateHaskellQuotes’ extension (implied by ‘TemplateHaskell’)
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XTemplateHaskellQuotes
