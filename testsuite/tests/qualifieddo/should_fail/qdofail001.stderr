     Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Char’
     In the pattern: ' '
      In a stmt of a qualified 'do' block: y@' ' <- [1, 2 :: Int]
      In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely
        ‘P.do x <- [1, 2]
              y@' ' <- [1, 2 :: Int]
              [1, 2]
              return y’
