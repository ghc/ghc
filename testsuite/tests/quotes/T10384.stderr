    • Ambiguous type variable ‘m0’ arising from a quotation bracket
      prevents the constraint ‘(GHC.Internal.TH.Syntax.Quote
                                  m0)’ from being solved.
      Relevant bindings include
        x :: (forall a. a -> a)
             -> GHC.Internal.TH.Syntax.Code m0 (a0 -> a0)
          (bound at T10384.hs:3:1)
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘m0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instance:
        instance GHC.Internal.TH.Syntax.Quote IO
          -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.TH.Syntax’
        ...plus one instance involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
