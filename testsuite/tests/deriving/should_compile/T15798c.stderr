T15798c.hs:6:12: warning: [GHC-55631] [-Wmissing-deriving-strategies]
    • No deriving strategy specified. Did you want stock, newtype, or anyclass?
    • In the data declaration for ‘Foo’
    Suggested fixes:
      • Use explicit deriving strategies: deriving stock (Eq)
      • Perhaps you intended to use the ‘DerivingStrategies’ extension (implied by ‘DerivingVia’)
