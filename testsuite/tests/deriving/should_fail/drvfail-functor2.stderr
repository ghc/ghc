drvfail-functor2.hs:2:29: warning: [-Wdeprecated-flags (in -Wdefault)]
    -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

drvfail-functor2.hs:8:14: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor InFunctionArgument’:
        Constructor ‘InFunctionArgument’ must not use the type variable in a function argument
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘InFunctionArgument’

drvfail-functor2.hs:11:14: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor OnSecondArg’:
        Constructor ‘OnSecondArg’ must use the type variable only as the last argument of a data type
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘OnSecondArg’

drvfail-functor2.hs:16:14: error:
    • Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form ‘Functor (NoArguments ...)’
        Class ‘Functor’ expects an argument of kind ‘* -> *’
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘NoArguments’

drvfail-functor2.hs:21:14: error:
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor StupidConstraint’:
        Data type ‘StupidConstraint’ must not have a class context: Eq a
    • In the data declaration for ‘StupidConstraint’

drvfail-functor2.hs:27:14: error:
    • No instance for (Functor NoFunctor)
        arising from the first field of ‘UseNoFunctor’ (type ‘NoFunctor a’)
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Functor UseNoFunctor)
