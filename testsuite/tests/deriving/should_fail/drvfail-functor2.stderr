drvfail-functor2.hs:1:29: Warning:
    -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

drvfail-functor2.hs:7:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‛Functor InFunctionArgument’:
      Constructor ‛InFunctionArgument’ must not use the type variable in a function argument
    In the newtype declaration for ‛InFunctionArgument’

drvfail-functor2.hs:10:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‛Functor OnSecondArg’:
      Constructor ‛OnSecondArg’ must use the type variable only as the last argument of a data type
    In the newtype declaration for ‛OnSecondArg’

drvfail-functor2.hs:15:14:
    Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form ‛Functor (NoArguments ...)’
      Class ‛Functor’ expects an argument of kind ‛* -> *’
    In the newtype declaration for ‛NoArguments’

drvfail-functor2.hs:20:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‛Functor StupidConstraint’:
      Data type ‛StupidConstraint’ must not have a class context (Eq a)
    In the data declaration for ‛StupidConstraint’

drvfail-functor2.hs:26:14:
    No instance for (Functor NoFunctor)
      arising from the first field of ‛UseNoFunctor’ (type ‛NoFunctor a’)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Functor UseNoFunctor)
