    • Couldn't match representation of type: c a
                               with that of: c (Down a)
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘intIso’
          from type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c a -> c Int’
            to type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c (Down a) -> c Int’
      Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c’ have;
            we must assume that the role is nominal.
