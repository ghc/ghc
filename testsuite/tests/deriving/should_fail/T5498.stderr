T5498.hs:30:39: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Down a’
        arising from defaulting the representational equality
          between: c a
              and: c (Down a)
        arising (via a quantified constraint) from
          the coercion of derived method ‘intIso’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the deriving clause for ‘IntIso (Down a)’
        at T5498.hs:30:39-44
      Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c’ have;
            we must assume that the role is nominal.
