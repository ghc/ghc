T8984.hs:7:46: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Couldn't match type ‘cat’ with ‘N cat’
        arising from defaulting the representational equality
          between: cat a (cat a Int)
              and: cat a (N cat a Int)
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘app’
          from type ‘cat a (cat a Int)’ to type ‘N cat a (N cat a Int)’
      ‘cat’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the deriving clause for ‘C (N cat a)’
        at T8984.hs:7:46
      • Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘cat’ have;
              we must assume that the role is nominal.
    • When deriving the instance for (C (N cat a))
