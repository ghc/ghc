    • Couldn't match representation of type: c Int
                               with that of: c Moo
        arising from the head of a quantified constraint
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘isInt’
          from type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Int’
            to type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Moo’
      Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c’ have;
            we must assume that the role is nominal.
