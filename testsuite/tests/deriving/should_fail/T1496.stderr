T1496.hs:10:32: error: [GHC-18872]
    • Couldn't match type ‘Int’ with ‘Moo’
        arising from defaulting the representational equality
          between: c Int
              and: c Moo
        arising (via a quantified constraint) from
          the coercion of derived method ‘isInt’
      Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c’ have;
            we must assume that the role is nominal.
