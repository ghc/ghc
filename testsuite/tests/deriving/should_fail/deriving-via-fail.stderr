    • Could not deduce ‘Show b’
        arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
      from the context: Coercible a b
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘Show (Foo1 a)’
        at deriving-via-fail.hs:10:34-37
      Possible fix:
        add (Show b) to the context of
          the deriving clause for ‘Show (Foo1 a)’
        or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
             so you can specify the instance context yourself
