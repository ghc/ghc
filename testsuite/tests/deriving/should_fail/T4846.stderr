T4846.hs:29:1:
    Could not coerce from ‘Expr Bool’ to ‘Expr BOOL’
      because the first type argument of ‘Expr’ has role Nominal,
      but the arguments ‘Bool’ and ‘BOOL’ differ
      arising from a use of ‘GHC.Prim.coerce’
    In the expression:
        GHC.Prim.coerce (mkExpr :: Expr Bool) :: Expr BOOL
    In an equation for ‘mkExpr’:
        mkExpr = GHC.Prim.coerce (mkExpr :: Expr Bool) :: Expr BOOL
    When typechecking the code for  ‘mkExpr’
      in a standalone derived instance for ‘B BOOL’:
      To see the code I am typechecking, use -ddump-deriv
    In the instance declaration for ‘B BOOL’
