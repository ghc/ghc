    Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘BOOL’
    arising from trying to show that the representations of
      ‘Expr Bool’ and
      ‘Expr BOOL’ are the same
    Relevant role signatures: type role Expr nominal
    In the expression:
        GHC.Prim.coerce (mkExpr :: Expr Bool) :: Expr BOOL
    In an equation for ‘mkExpr’:
        mkExpr = GHC.Prim.coerce (mkExpr :: Expr Bool) :: Expr BOOL
    When typechecking the code for ‘mkExpr’
      in a derived instance for ‘B BOOL’:
      To see the code I am typechecking, use -ddump-deriv
    In the instance declaration for ‘B BOOL’
