drvfail012.hs:5:33: error: [GHC-39999]
    • Could not deduce ‘Eq (Ego a)’
        arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
      from the context: Ord a
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘Ord (Ego a)’
        at drvfail012.hs:5:33-35
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Ord (Ego a))
