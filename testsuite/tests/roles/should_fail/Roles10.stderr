    Could not coerce from ‘Bool’ to ‘Char’
      because ‘Bool’ and ‘Char’ are different types.
      arising from the coercion of the method ‘meth’ from type
                   ‘Int -> F Int’ to type ‘Age -> F Age’
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (C Age)
