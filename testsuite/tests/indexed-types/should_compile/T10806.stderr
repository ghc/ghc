    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Char -> Bool’
                  with actual type ‘IO ()’
    • The function ‘print’ is applied to two value arguments,
        but its type ‘Char -> IO ()’ has only one
      In the expression: print 'x' 'y'
      In an equation for ‘triggersLoop’:
          triggersLoop (Q _ _) (Q _ _) = print 'x' 'y'
