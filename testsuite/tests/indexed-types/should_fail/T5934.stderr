    • Cannot instantiate unification variable ‘a0’
      with a type involving foralls: (forall s. GenST s) -> Int
        GHC doesn't yet support impredicative polymorphism

T5934.hs:12:7: error:
    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from the literal ‘0’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Num a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      These potential instances exist:
        instance Num Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
        instance Num Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Float’
        instance Num Float -- Defined in ‘GHC.Float’
        ...plus two others
