    Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type:
      a0 ~ Base t0 (Prim [a0] a0)
    Expected type: Prim [a0] a0 -> Base t0 (Prim [a0] a0)
      Actual type: Prim [a0] a0 -> a0
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: Prim [a0] a0 -> t0 (bound at T7354.hs:28:1)
    In the first argument of ‘ana’, namely ‘alg’
    In the expression: ana alg
    In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = ana alg
