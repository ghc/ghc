    Couldn't match type ‘Memo d’ with ‘Memo d0’
    NB: ‘Memo’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘d0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Memo d a -> Memo d a
      Actual type: Memo d0 a -> Memo d0 a
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘f’:
      f :: forall d a. Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘f’: f :: (Fun d) => Memo d a -> Memo d a
