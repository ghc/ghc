    Could not deduce (Depend a0 ~ Depend a)
    from the context (Bug a)
      bound by the inferred type for ‘isValid’:
                 Bug a => [Depend a] -> Bool
      at T1897b.hs:16:1-41
    NB: ‘Depend’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: [Depend a] -> Bool
      Actual type: [Depend a0] -> Bool
    When checking that ‘isValid’
      has the inferred type ‘forall a. Bug a => [Depend a] -> Bool’
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
