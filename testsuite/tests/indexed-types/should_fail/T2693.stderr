    Couldn't match expected type ‘TFn a’ with actual type ‘TFn a0’
    NB: ‘TFn’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    When checking that ‘x’ has the inferred type
      x :: forall a0. TFn a0
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In the expression:
      do { let Just x = ...;
           let n = fst x + fst x;
           return () }
    In an equation for ‘f’:
        f = do { let Just x = ...;
                 let n = ...;
                 return () }
