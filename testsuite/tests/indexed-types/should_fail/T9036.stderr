    Couldn't match type ‘GetMonad t0’ with ‘GetMonad t’
    NB: ‘GetMonad’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
      Actual type: Maybe (GetMonad t0 after) -> Curried t0 [t0]
    In the ambiguity check for:
      forall t after. Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘simpleLogger’:
      simpleLogger :: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> t `Curried` [t]
