    • Couldn't match type ‘Curried t0 [t0]’ with ‘Curried t [t]’
      Expected type: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
        Actual type: Maybe (GetMonad t0 after) -> Curried t0 [t0]
      NB: ‘Curried’ is a non-injective type family
      The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    • In the ambiguity check for ‘simpleLogger’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the type signature:
        simpleLogger :: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> t `Curried` [t]
