    Couldn't match type ‘Curried t0 [t0]’ with ‘Curried t [t]’
    NB: ‘Curried’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
      Actual type: Maybe (GetMonad t0 after) -> Curried t0 [t0]
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘simpleLogger’:
      simpleLogger :: forall t after.
                      Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘simpleLogger’:
      simpleLogger :: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> t `Curried` [t]
