    Couldn't match expected type ‛T a0’ with actual type ‛T b’
    NB: ‛T’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‛a0’ is ambiguous
    Relevant bindings include

    In the second argument of ‛foo’, namely ‛x’
    In the expression: foo (error "urk") x
    In an equation for ‛bar1’: bar1 a x = foo (error "urk") x
