    Couldn't match expected type ‘T a0’ with actual type ‘T b’
    NB: ‘T’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: T b (bound at T4099.hs:11:8)
      a :: b (bound at T4099.hs:11:6)
      bar1 :: b -> T b -> Int (bound at T4099.hs:11:1)
    In the second argument of ‘foo’, namely ‘x’
    In the expression: foo (error "urk") x

    Couldn't match expected type ‘T a1’ with actual type ‘Maybe b’
    The type variable ‘a1’ is ambiguous
