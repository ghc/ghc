    Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Int’
    ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for:
        bar3wrong :: forall a. S3 a -> a
      at SimpleFail5a.hs:30:14
    Expected type: S3 a
      Actual type: S3 Int
    Relevant bindings include
      bar3wrong :: S3 a -> a (bound at SimpleFail5a.hs:31:1)
    In the pattern: D3Int
    In an equation for ‘bar3wrong’: bar3wrong D3Int = 1
