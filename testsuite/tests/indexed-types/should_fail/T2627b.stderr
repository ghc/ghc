    • Could not deduce ‘Dual (Dual a0) ~ a0’
        arising from a use of ‘conn’

        bound by the type signature for:
                   conn :: forall a b.

      The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    • In the expression: conn undefined undefined
      In an equation for ‘conn’:
          conn (Rd k) (Wr a r) = conn undefined undefined
