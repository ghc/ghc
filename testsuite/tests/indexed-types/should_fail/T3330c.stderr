      `f1' is a rigid type variable bound by
           a pattern with constructor
             RSum :: forall (f :: * -> *) (g :: * -> *).

    Expected type: Der ((->) x) (t0 x)
      Actual type: R f1
    In the first argument of `plug', namely `rf'
    In the first argument of `Inl', namely `(plug rf df x)'
    In the expression: Inl (plug rf df x)
