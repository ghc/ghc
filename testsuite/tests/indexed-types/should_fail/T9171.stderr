    NB: ‘GetParam’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The kind variable ‘k0’ is ambiguous
    Use -fprint-explicit-kinds to see the kind arguments
    When checking that ‘foo’ has the inferred type
      foo :: forall (k :: BOX). GetParam Base (GetParam Base Int)
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
