    Couldn't match type ‘Scalar (V (Scalar (V a)))’ with ‘Scalar (V a)’
    NB: ‘Scalar’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: Scalar (V a)
      Actual type: Scalar (V (Scalar (V a)))
                   -> Scalar (V (Scalar (V a)))
    Relevant bindings include
      seg :: a (bound at T8227.hs:16:21)
      eps :: Scalar (V a) (bound at T8227.hs:16:17)
      absoluteToParam :: Scalar (V a) -> a -> Scalar (V a)
        (bound at T8227.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: arcLengthToParam eps eps
    In an equation for ‘absoluteToParam’:
        absoluteToParam eps seg = arcLengthToParam eps eps
