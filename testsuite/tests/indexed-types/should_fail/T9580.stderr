    • Couldn't match representation of type ‘Dimensional Int Double’
                               with that of ‘Double’
        arising from a use of ‘coerce’
      Note: The type ‘Dimensional
                        Int v’ is an opaque newtype, whose constructor is hidden.
    • In the expression: coerce x
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo x = coerce x
