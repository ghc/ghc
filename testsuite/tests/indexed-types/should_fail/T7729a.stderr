    Couldn't match type ‘BasePrimMonad m’ with ‘t0 (BasePrimMonad m)’
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a
      Actual type: t0 (BasePrimMonad m) a
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a (bound at T7729a.hs:36:12)
      liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
        (bound at T7729a.hs:36:3)
    In the first argument of ‘liftPrim’, namely ‘(lift x)’
    In the expression: liftPrim (lift x)
