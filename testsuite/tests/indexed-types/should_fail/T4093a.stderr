    Could not deduce (e ~ ())

      ‛e’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for hang :: Foo e ~ Maybe e => Foo e
          at T4093a.hs:7:9
    Expected type: Foo e
      Actual type: Maybe ()
    Relevant bindings include hang :: Foo e (bound at T4093a.hs:8:1)
    In the return type of a call of ‛Just’
    In the expression: Just ()
    In an equation for ‛hang’: hang = Just ()
