    Could not deduce (Foo e0 ~ Maybe e)
    from the context (Foo e ~ Maybe e)
      bound by the type signature for hang :: (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
      at T4093a.hs:7:9-34
    The type variable ‘e0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Foo e
      Actual type: Foo e0
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘hang’:
      hang :: forall e. (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘hang’:
      hang :: (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
