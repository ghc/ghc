    NB: ‛IxMap’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‛i0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: IxMap l [Int]
      Actual type: IxMap i0 [Int]
    Relevant bindings include

    In the first argument of ‛BiApp’, namely ‛empty’
    In the expression: BiApp empty empty
    In an equation for ‛empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
