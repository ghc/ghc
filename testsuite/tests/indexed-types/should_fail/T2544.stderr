    Could not deduce (IxMap i1 ~ IxMap r)
    from the context (Ix l, Ix r)
      bound by the instance declaration at T2544.hs:13:10-37
    NB: ‘IxMap’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘i1’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int]
      Actual type: BiApp (IxMap i0) (IxMap i1) [Int]
    Relevant bindings include
      empty :: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int] (bound at T2544.hs:15:4)
    In the expression: BiApp empty empty
    In an equation for ‘empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
