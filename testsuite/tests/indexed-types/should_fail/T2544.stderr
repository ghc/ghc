    Couldn't match type ‘IxMap i0’ with ‘IxMap l’
    NB: ‘IxMap’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘i0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: IxMap l [Int]
      Actual type: IxMap i0 [Int]
    Relevant bindings include

    In the first argument of ‘BiApp’, namely ‘empty’
    In the expression: BiApp empty empty
    In an equation for ‘empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
