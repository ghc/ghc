    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘TermFamily a a’
      Expected: TermFamily a (TermFamily a a)
        Actual: TermFamily a a
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          laws :: forall a b. TermLike a => TermFamily a a -> b
        at T4272.hs:14:1-53
    • In the first argument of ‘terms’, namely
        ‘(undefined :: TermFamily a a)’
      In the second argument of ‘prune’, namely
        ‘(terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))’
      In the expression: prune t (terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))
    • Relevant bindings include
        t :: TermFamily a a (bound at T4272.hs:15:6)
        laws :: TermFamily a a -> b (bound at T4272.hs:15:1)
