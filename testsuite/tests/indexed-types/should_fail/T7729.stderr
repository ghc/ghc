    Could not deduce (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)
                      ~ t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)))
    from the context (PrimMonad (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)),
                      Monad (Rand m),
                      MonadPrim m)
      bound by the instance declaration at T7729.hs:26:10-42
    The type variable ‛t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)) a -> Rand m a
      Actual type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
    Relevant bindings include
      liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
        (bound at T7729.hs:28:3)
    In the first argument of ‛(.)’, namely ‛liftPrim’
    In the expression: liftPrim . lift
    In an equation for ‛liftPrim’: liftPrim = liftPrim . lift
