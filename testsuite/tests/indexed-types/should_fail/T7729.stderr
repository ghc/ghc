T7729.hs:36:14: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘BasePrimMonad m’ with ‘t0 (BasePrimMonad m)’
    The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: t0 (BasePrimMonad m) a -> Rand m a
      Actual type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
    Relevant bindings include
      liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
        (bound at T7729.hs:36:3)
    In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘liftPrim’
    In the expression: liftPrim . lift
    In an equation for ‘liftPrim’: liftPrim = liftPrim . lift
