    Couldn't match expected type ‘r0’ with actual type ‘r1’
      ‘r1’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints: t0 ~ Int
        bound by a pattern with constructor: K :: T Int,
                 in a case alternative
        at gadt7.hs:16:33
    ‘r1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of i1b :: T t0 -> r1 -> r0 at gadt7.hs:16:1
    ‘r0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of i1b :: T t0 -> r1 -> r0 at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T t0 -> r1 -> r0 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
    In the expression: case t1 of { K -> y1 }
