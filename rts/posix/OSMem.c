/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The mmap() method

   On Unix-like systems, we use mmap() to allocate our memory.  We
   want memory in chunks of MBLOCK_SIZE, and aligned on an MBLOCK_SIZE
   boundary.  The mmap() interface doesn't give us this level of
   control, so we have to use some heuristics.

   In the general case, if we want a block of n megablocks, then we
   allocate n+1 and trim off the slop from either side (using
   munmap()) to get an aligned chunk of size n.  However, the next
   time we'll try to allocate directly after the previously allocated
   chunk, on the grounds that this is aligned and likely to be free.
   If it turns out that we were wrong, we have to munmap() and try
   again using the general method.

   Note on posix_memalign(): this interface is available on recent
   systems and appears to provide exactly what we want.  However, it
   turns out not to be as good as our mmap() implementation, because
   it wastes extra space (using double the address space, in a test on
   x86_64/Linux).  The problem seems to be that posix_memalign()
   returns memory that can be free()'d, so the library must store
   extra information along with the allocated block, thus messing up
   the alignment.  Hence, we don't use posix_memalign() for now.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/*
 A wrapper around mmap(), to abstract away from OS differences in
 the mmap() interface.

 It supports the following operations:
 - reserve: find a new chunk of available address space, and make it so
            that we own it (no other library will get it), but don't actually
            allocate memory for it
            the addr is a hint for where to place the memory (and most
            of the time the OS happily ignores!)
 - commit: given a chunk of address space that we know we own, make sure
           there is some memory backing it
           the addr is not a hint, it must point into previously reserved
           address space, or bad things happen
 - reserve&commit: do both at the same time

 The naming is chosen from the Win32 API (VirtualAlloc) which does the
 same thing and has done so forever, while support for this in Unix systems
 has only been added recently and is hidden in the posix portability mess.
 The Linux manpage suggests that mmap must be passed MAP_NORESERVE in order
 to get reservation-only behavior. It is confusing because to get the reserve
 behavior we need MAP_NORESERVE (which tells the kernel not to allocate backing
 space), but heh...

/* Note [MADV_FREE and MADV_DONTNEED]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * madvise() provides flags with which one can release no longer needed pages
 * back to the kernel without having to munmap() (which is expensive).
 *
 * On Linux, MADV_FREE is newer and faster because it can avoid zeroing
 * pages if they are re-used by the process later (see `man 2 madvise`),
 * but for the trade-off that memory inspection tools like `top` will
 * not immediately reflect the freeing in their display of resident memory
 * (RSS column): Only under memory pressure will Linux actually remove
 * the freed pages from the process and update its RSS statistics.
 * Until then, the pages show up as `LazyFree` in `/proc/PID/smaps`
 * (see `man 5 proc`).
 * The delayed RSS update can confuse programmers debugging memory issues,
 * production memory monitoring tools, and end users who may complain about
 * undue memory usage shown in reporting tools, so with
 * `disableDelayedOsMemoryReturn` we provide an RTS flag that allows forcing
 * usage of MADV_DONTNEED instead of MADV_FREE.
