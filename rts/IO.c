 *
 * Hooks for the I/O subsystem(s) that are called from other parts of the RTS.
 *
 * There are several different I/O subsystem implementations, for different
 * platforms (notably Windows vs others), and for the threaded vs non-threaded
 * RTS. These implementations all need hooks into other parts of the RTS, such
 * as startup/shutdown, the scheduler and other special features.
 *
 * To keep things comprehensible, all the hooks used by all the different I/O
 * subsystem implementations are centralised here. Not all implementations use
 * all hooks.
