/* The gct variable is thread-local and points to the current thread's
   gc_thread structure. It is heavily accessed, and thus high
   performance access is crucial to parallel (-threaded) workloads.

   First, we try to use a 'global register variable' which is a GCC
   extension. This reserves the register globally.

   If that's not possible, then we need to use __thread, which is a
   compiler/OS specific TLS storage mechanism (assumed to be Fast
   Enough.)

   BUT, some older versions of OS X compilers (llvm-gcc, older Clangs)
   do not support __thread at all. Modern clang however, does - but on
   OS X it's not as fast as the Linux (which can write directly into a
   segment register - see #7602.)

   If we don't support __thread then we do the absolute worst thing:
   we just use pthread_getspecific and pthread_setspecific (which are
   horribly slow.)
