Note [Lack of signals on wasm32-wasi]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the wasm32-wasi spec, there is no process/thread model, no
preemptive execution, and no posix-style asynchronous signals. See
WASI ticket #166 for upstream discussion about signal handling.

In wasi-libc, signal.h includes an #error pragma in the default
setting that says: "wasm lacks signal support; to enable minimal
signal emulation, compile with -D_WASI_EMULATED_SIGNAL and link with
-lwasi-emulated-signal". It is possible to enable these flags when
configuring wasm32-wasi-ghc, but it still makes little sense, since
the emulation is really primitive and we might as well just stop
pretending signals exist at all.

Therefore, in the entire GHC tree, whenever we define functionality
related to posix signals, we should add the CPP guards. When the
target lacks signals, we can't set signal handlers at all, and raising
a signal should degrade to exiting with the signal number as the exit
code.
