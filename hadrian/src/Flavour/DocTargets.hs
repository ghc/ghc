--   While we can't reasonably expose settings or CLI options
--   to selectively disable, say, base's haddocks, we can offer
--   a less fine-grained choice:
--
--   - haddocks for libraries
--   - non-haddock html pages (e.g GHC's user manual)
--   - PDF documents (e.g haddock's manual)
--   - man pages (GHC's)
--
--   The main goal being to have easy ways to do away with the need
--   for e.g @sphinx-build@ or @xelatex@ and associated packages
--   while still being able to build a(n almost) complete binary
--   distribution.
