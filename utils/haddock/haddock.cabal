synopsis:             A documentation-generation tool for Haskell libraries
description:
  This is Haddock, a tool for automatically generating documentation
  from annotated Haskell source code. It is primary intended for documenting
  library interfaces, but it should be useful for any kind of Haskell code.
  .
  Haddock lets you write documentation annotations next to the definitions of
  functions and types in the source code, in a syntax that is easy on the eye
  when writing the source code (no heavyweight mark-up).
  .
  Haddock understands Haskell's module system, so you can structure your code
  however you like without worrying that internal structure will be exposed in
  the generated documentation. For example, it is common to implement a library
  in several modules, but define the external API by having a single module
  which re-exports parts of these implementation modules. Using Haddock, you can
  still write documentation annotations next to the actual definitions of the
  functions and types in the library, but the documentation annotations from the
  implementation will be propagated to the external API when the documentation is
  generated. Abstract types and classes are handled correctly. In fact, even
  without any documentation annotations, Haddock can generate useful documentation
  from your source code.
  .
  Documentation for the haddock binary is available at [readthedocs](https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
