# 
# It is possible to configure the compiler and prelude to support 31-bit
# integers, suitable for a back-end and RTS using a tag bit on a 32-bit
# architecture.  Currently the only useful output from this option is external Core
# files.  The following additions to your build.mk will produce the
# 31-bit core output.  Note that this is *not* just a library "way"; the
# compiler must be built a special way too.
