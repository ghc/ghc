# In emergency situations, REAL_SHELL is used to perform shell commands

# The reason for having to do this is that overly long command lines
# cause unnecessary trouble with some shells (e.g., /bin/sh on Solaris
# 2.5.1), which is why this backdoor is provided. The situation of overly
# long command lines is either encountered while doing `make boot' in compiler/, 
# or when linking the compiler binary (`hsc'). 
#
# We do not use SHELL to execute long commands, as `make' will more than likely
# override whatever setting you have in your environment while executing. 

# By default, REAL_SHELL is set equal to SHELL, which is not really a smart move
# as it is SHELL that will show up the bogosity in the first place, but setting
# it to anything else isn't really portable.
#
#  ====> If long command lines cause you trouble, invoke `ghc' (via `make' or otherwise)
# with REAL_SHELL set to something else than /bin/sh, for instance, your favourite
# command shell.
