# This file supplies defaults for many tweakable build configuration
# options.  Some of the defaults are filled in by the autoconf-generated
# configure script.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
#
# 	- config.mk is auto-generated from config.mk.in by configure.
#	  This may be triggered automatically by the build system (say
#	  if config.mk.in has changed more recently than config.mk),
#	  so if you edit config.mk your changes will be spammed.
#
#	- Settings in this file may be overriden by giving replacement
#	  definitions in build.mk.  See build.mk.sample for a good
#	  starting point for a build.mk file.
#
#	  If you don't have a build.mk file then you get defaults for everything.
#	  The defaults should provide a reasonable vanilla build.
#
# This is one of only two files that configure generates (the other is config.h)
#
# There is a section below for each project within the fptools suite
#
#	PLUS
#
# a section corresponding to each of the main .mk files 
# included by boilerplate.mk (see boilerplate.mk for a list).

#		Project-wide platform variables
#
################################################################################

# A "platform" is the GNU cpu-type/manufacturer/operating-system target machine
# specifier.  E.g. sparc-sun-solaris2
#
# Build  platform: the platform on which we are doing this build
# Host   platform: the platform on which these binaries will run
# Target platform: the platform for which this compiler will generate code
#
# We don't support build & host being different, because the build
# process creates binaries that are run during the build, and also
# installed.
#
# If host & target are different, then we are building a compiler
# which will generate intermediate .hc files to port to the target
# architecture for bootstrapping.  The libraries and stage 2 compiler
# will be built as HC files for the target system, and likely won't
# build on this host platform.
#
# An important invariant is that for any piece of source code, the
# platform on which the code is going to run is the HOST platform,
# and the platform on which we are building is the BUILD platform.
# Additionally for the compiler, the platform this compiler will
# generate code for is the TARGET.  TARGET is not meaningful outside
# the compiler sources.
#
# Guidelines for when to use HOST vs. TARGET:
#
#  - In the build system (Makefile, foo.mk), normally we should test
#    $(HOSTPLATFORM).  There are some cases (eg. installation), where
#    we expect $(HOSTPLATFORM)==$(TARGETPLATFORM), so in those cases it
#    doesn't matter which is used.
#
#  - In the compiler itself, we should test HOST or TARGET depending
#    on whether the conditional relates to the code being generated, or
#    the platform on which the compiler is running.  See the section
#    on "Coding Style" in the commentary for more details.
#
#  - In all other code, we should be testing HOST only.
#
# NOTE: cross-compiling is not well supported by the build system.
# You have to do a lot of work by hand to cross compile: see the
# section on "Porting GHC" in the Building Guide.

# In emergency situations, REAL_SHELL is used to perform shell commands
# from within the ghc driver script, by scribbling the command line to
# a temp file and then having $(REAL_SHELL) execute it. 
#
# The reason for having to do this is that overly long command lines
# cause unnecessary trouble with some shells (e.g., /bin/sh on Solaris
# 2.5.1), which is why this backdoor is provided. The situation of overly
# long command lines is either encountered while doing `make boot' in ghc/compiler, 
# or when linking the compiler binary (`hsc'). 
#
# We do not use SHELL to execute long commands, as `make' will more than likely
# override whatever setting you have in your environment while executing. 

# By default, REAL_SHELL is set equal to SHELL, which is not really a smart move
# as it is SHELL that will show up the bogosity in the first place, but setting
# it to anything else isn't really portable.
#
#  ====> If long command lines cause you trouble, invoke `ghc' (via `make' or otherwise)
# with REAL_SHELL set to something else than /bin/sh, for instance, your favourite
# command shell.

# Options for the compiling different `ways'. Various projects within
# the glorious fptools tree support building in various user-configured
# ways. For instance, you could set up one `way' such that the prelude
# libraries all were built with the option -ffoldr-build-on.
# 
# To configure up your own way, have a look at some of the standard ways
# such as profiling, and create your own set of WAY_*_OPTS defs below.
# After having done that, add your way string to WAYS, and after having
# run the configure script, the different projects will add the new way
# to the list of ways they support.
#

#
# IMPORTANT! The WAYS variable configures the different `ways'
# you want to build a project (or maybe just parts of it, as is
# the case for ghc/). This variable is intended set inside the
# project mk setup, enforcing a global fptools WAYS is a bit too
# much (do you *really* want to build glafp-utils the profiled-concurrent 
# way?)
#

#
# Definitions of the different ways:
#   
#   * their name:
#          - tag, e.g., p
#          - description, e.g., profiling
#   * what they mean to the driver:
#          - WAY_p_HC_OPTS gives the list of command-line options
#            to the driver.
#

#
# The ways currently defined.
#
ALL_WAYS=p t u s mp mg a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o A B
USER_WAYS=a b c d e f g h j k l m n o A B

#
# The following ways currently have treated specially, p u t mg,
# as the driver script treats these guys specially and needs to carefully be told
# about the options for these. Hence, we hide the required command line options
# for these in the ghc/driver, as this is the only place they are needed.

# It is possible to configure the compiler and prelude to support 31-bit
# integers, suitable for a back-end and RTS using a tag bit on a 32-bit
# architecture.  Currently the only useful output from this option is external Core
# files.  The following additions to your build.mk will produce the
# 31-bit core output.  Note that this is *not* just a library "way"; the
# compiler must be built a special way too.
