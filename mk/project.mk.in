# GHC Version

# ProjectVersion    is treated as a *string*
# ProjectVersionInt is treated as an *integer* (for cpp defines)

# Versioning scheme: A.B.C
#         A: major version, decimal, any number of digits
#         B: minor version, decimal, any number of digits
#     C: patchlevel, one digit, omitted if zero.
#
# ProjectVersionInt does *not* contain the patchlevel (rationale: this
# figure is used for conditional compilations, and library interfaces
# etc. are not supposed to change between patchlevels).
#
# The ProjectVersionInt is included in interface files, and GHC
# checks that it's reading interface generated by the same ProjectVersion
# as itself. It does this even though interface file syntax may not
# change between versions.  Rationale: calling conventions or other
# random .o-file stuff might change even if the .hi syntax doesn't

################################################################################

# A "platform" is the GNU cpu-type/manufacturer/operating-system target machine
# specifier.  E.g. x86_64-apple-darwin
#
# Build  platform: the platform on which we are doing this build
# Host   platform: the platform on which these binaries will run
# Target platform: the platform for which this compiler will generate code
#
# We don't support build & host being different, because the build
# process creates binaries that are run during the build, and also
# installed.
#
# If host & target are different, then we are building a compiler
# which will generate intermediate .hc files to port to the target
# architecture for bootstrapping.  The libraries and stage 2 compiler
# will be built as HC files for the target system, and likely won't
# build on this host platform.
#
# An important invariant is that for any piece of source code, the
# platform on which the code is going to run is the HOST platform,
# and the platform on which we are building is the BUILD platform.
# Additionally for the compiler, the platform this compiler will
# generate code for is the TARGET.  TARGET is not meaningful outside
# the compiler sources.
#
# Guidelines for when to use HOST vs. TARGET:
#
#  - In the build system (Makefile, foo.mk), normally we should test
#    $(HOSTPLATFORM).  There are some cases (eg. installation), where
#    we expect $(HOSTPLATFORM)==$(TARGETPLATFORM), so in those cases it
#    doesn't matter which is used.
#
#  - In the compiler itself, we should test HOST or TARGET depending
#    on whether the conditional relates to the code being generated, or
#    the platform on which the compiler is running.  See the section
#    on "coding-style" in the commentary for more details.
#
#  - In all other code, we should be testing HOST only.
#
# NOTE: cross-compiling is not well supported by the build system.
# You have to do a lot of work by hand to cross compile: see the
# section on "Porting GHC" in the Building Guide.
