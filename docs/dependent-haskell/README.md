# Dependent Haskell project

The long-term goal is dependent types in Haskell. The first experiment is a
retained Boolean argument whose value determines the result type. Extend Core
from Eisenberg's historical `nokinds-pi` work, ported and completed on current
GHC. Keep the validated `singletons` encoding as a comparison implementation.

The current direction is native dependent Core. The historical branch is
unfinished. It supplies binder and application design work, but dependent type
computation and Boolean elimination need completion. The native target must accept
ordinary runtime Boolean bindings directly and preserve laziness. Singleton
reification remains specific to the comparison implementation.

## Native Core implementation

`TermVarTy` refers to the index of an existing runtime Boolean identifier.
`DepFunTy` binds that identifier in a dependent result type. Type recovery and
Core Lint agree on retained application. The implementation includes scope,
capture avoidance, supported index substitution, alpha equality, and diagnostic
printing. It does not add a singleton argument or evaluate index variables.

Boolean alternatives can bind checked nominal equality evidence. The strict case
justifies each proof. Proof-bearing cases must cover both Boolean values, and
each proof stays inside its branch. The existing result annotation scope remains.

The `NativeDependentCore` GHC API regression checks constructor and shared-variable
applications, substitution composition, binder cloning, invalid indices, scope
errors, and boundary gates. It also checks `Select True = Int`,
`Select False = Bool`, shared-index composition, branch casts, and forged proofs.

The frontend cannot produce the new forms. The ordinary optimizer, default
CorePrep entry, program backend entry, and interface serialization reject them.
There is no performance measurement for the changed type traversals.

## Native execution

`hscCompileCoreExpr` now has a restricted native path. It skips the ordinary
simplifier and runs Core Lint before and after CorePrep. CorePrep preserves native
types, clones proof types with their Boolean indices, and supports retained eta
binders. CoreToStg removes virtual Boolean proofs and casts. STG Lint checks the
runtime argument representations before bytecode generation. The normal pipeline
keeps its rejection gates. JavaScript execution remains unsupported.

`NativeDependentCoreRun` compiles each `choose` and shared `keep`/`choose` worker
once. An ordinary helper supplies both Boolean inputs through an IORef. The
results are `42` for `True` and `False` for `False`. The shared path uses an
explicit retained eta expansion. It does not add a singleton argument.

The laziness observations have separate types:

- `keepSelect bottom` reaches function WHNF. This test does not construct a
  non-bottom value of type `Select bottom`.
- A fully applied indexed `keep` returns `42` with a bottom Boolean. Its value has
  type `(b ~ b) => Int`. Ordinary reflexivity supplies the dictionary without
  evaluating `b`.
- A lazy local index can refer to a global Boolean thunk. CorePrep must preserve
  the local binding when its RHS cannot replace an index.
- `choose bottom` raises the named Boolean-bottom exception.

Prepared Core and STG inspection confirmed one Boolean argument for `choose` and
Boolean/value arguments for `keep`. The `keep` closure returns the value without
scrutinizing the Boolean. Index-only dependencies do not add runtime captures.
The branch proofs disappear from STG, and the strict Boolean cases remain.

Compiler source commit `5a636d9274` passed the final default Hadrian rebuild on
2026-11-12. The command used `-j6 --flavour=default --docs=none`. Hadrian reported
7m31s. The memory scope recorded a peak of 4,658 MiB under a 16 GiB cap with no
swap. This was an incremental rebuild.

The registered test run selected `NativeDependentCore NativeDependentCoreRun`
with `--test-way=normal`. Both tests passed. Twenty other ways were skipped, and
there were no unexpected failures or framework warnings. The test scope peaked
at 2,476 MiB under an 8 GiB cap. Both tests also passed against the bootstrap API
library; runtime execution used the matching target libraries and an external
interpreter.

Ordinary smoke checks passed package registration, `-O2 -dcore-lint`, Template
Haskell, threaded execution, GHCi, and Haddock startup. The standalone singleton
comparison and exact pinned `Data.Singletons` source passed at `-O0` and `-O2`
with Core Lint. The expected mismatch was rejected.

Hadrian reported a nonfatal configuration comparison between `lib` and `lib/.`.
It continued with its in-tree arguments. Package registration reported missing
documentation because documentation generation was disabled.

The full testsuite and documentation build have not run. This work establishes
bytecode execution for the restricted Core examples. It does not establish
ordinary optimizer preservation or a source language. Native machine-code
compilation remains behind the program gate. All commits are local.

## Verified baseline

The default Hadrian build passed with six workers and `--docs=none`. The build
produced `_build/stage1/bin/ghc`, version `10.1.20261109`. Hadrian reported
30 minutes 48 seconds. The memory scope recorded a peak of 10,577 MiB under a
16 GiB cap with swap disabled.

The boot compiler was GHC 9.14.1. The Cabal version was 3.18.1.0. Nix supplied
Autoconf 2.72, Automake 1.18.1, Happy 2.1.7, and Alex 3.5.4.0.

Focused smoke checks passed. They covered package registration, optimized
compilation with Core Lint, Template Haskell, threaded execution, GHCi, and
Haddock startup. Documentation generation and the full testsuite were not run.
Package registration emitted missing-documentation warnings because documentation
was disabled.

The local build commands used these steps:

```sh
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/bin/g++ LD=/usr/bin/ld
./boot
./configure GHC=/home/tritlo/.ghcup/bin/ghc-9.14.1
cabal --project-file="$PWD/hadrian/cabal.project" build \
  --with-compiler=/home/tritlo/.ghcup/bin/ghc-9.14.1 \
  --disable-documentation --disable-profiling --disable-library-profiling \
  -j6 exe:hadrian
cabal --project-file="$PWD/hadrian/cabal.project" exec \
  --with-compiler=/home/tritlo/.ghcup/bin/ghc-9.14.1 \
  --disable-documentation --disable-profiling --disable-library-profiling \
  hadrian -- --directory "$PWD" -j6 --flavour=default --docs=none
```

Use an absolute path for `--project-file`. A relative path resolved the package
locations incorrectly. Supply the required tools on `PATH`. On this WSL2 host,
run builds and checks through `/home/tritlo/Code/heavy-management`. Read its
current scripts before reuse. Preserve the queue's concurrency settings.

Local build scripts, logs, and memory records are in `_build/verification/`.
They are ignored build artifacts. The results above describe the pinned baseline;
they do not describe later source revisions.

## Verified singleton translation

The unmodified upstream `Data.Singletons` module compiled against the baseline
with a small `SBool` and `SingKind Bool` adapter. Its source blob was
`c6bf5970d85d28ed6edb4d887f14cfa127a01be2`.

The reference program passed at `-O0` and `-O2`, both with `-dcore-lint`. It checked:

- `Select True = Int` and `Select False = Bool`.
- Branch refinement through `STrue` and `SFalse`.
- Shared index use in `keepS sb (chooseS sb)`.
- Runtime input through `withSomeSing @Bool`.
- Non-strict behavior when `keepS` ignores its witness.
- Rejection of `keepS STrue False`.

The reification check confirmed this distinction:

```haskell
keepS @True undefined `seq` ()                 -- Terminates.
withSomeSing @Bool undefined (\_ -> ())        -- Diverges.
```

These results establish the reference encoding. They do not establish a frontend
implementation or full-package compatibility. HEAD has `base-4.23.0.0`. The
inspected `singletons` package excludes that version in its bounds.
`singletons-base` also targets the GHC 9.14 Template Haskell API.

The temporary evidence is at `/tmp/ghc-retained-bool-plan.DJqnmf/`:
`Oracle.hs`, `Reject.hs`, `LibraryOracle.hs`, `check.log`, and `library-check.log`.
The temporary directory can expire. The maintained comparison sources and
reproduction recipe are now in [reference/](reference/README.md).

## How to resume

1. Read this file and the next unchecked milestone in [the plan](PLAN.md).
2. Check `git status`, the current branch, and the source revision. Compare them
   with the baseline above before reusing build results.
3. Read the relevant primary sources in [the references](REFERENCES.md).
   Recheck proposal and package status when the work depends on it.
4. Complete one milestone at a time. Keep changes small and reviewable. Run the
   acceptance checks that apply to the milestone.
5. Update this status and the plan after a material result or scope change.
   Record the source revision, command, outcome, and remaining boundary.

Keep new research in `REFERENCES.md`. Keep implementation tasks in `PLAN.md`.
Do not turn the project index into an implementation log. Significant changes
to the language scope or Core strategy require a new design discussion.
