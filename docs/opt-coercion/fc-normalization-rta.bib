  of functions are explicitly typed and both type abstraction and type
  instantiation are explicit. However, type instantiation in xMLF is more
  general than type application in System F. We equip xMLF with a small-step
  reduction semantics that allows reduction in any context and show that this

ABSTRACT = {
MLF is a type system that seamlessly merges ML-style type inference with
System-F polymorphism. We propose a system of graphic (type) constraints
that can be used to perform type inference in both ML or MLF. We show
that this constraint system is a small extension of the formalism of
graphic types, originally introduced to represent MLF types. We give a
few semantic preserving transformations on constraints and propose a
strategy for applying them to solve constraints. We show that the
resulting algorithm has optimal complexity for MLF type inference, and
argue that, as for ML, this complexity is linear under reasonable
assumptions.

Gentzen's Hauptsatz -- cut elimination theorem -- in sequent calculi
reveals a fundamental property on logic connectives in various logics such
as classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  In this paper, we implement a
procedure in Haskell to perform cut elimination for intuitionistic sequent
calculus, where we use types to guarantee that the procedure can only
return a cut-free proof of the same sequent when given a proof of a sequent
that may contain cuts.  The contribution of the paper is two-fold.  On
the one hand, we present an interesting (and somewhat unexpected) application
of the current type system of Haskell, illustrating through a concrete
example how some typical use of dependent types can be simulated in
Haskell. On the other hand, we identify several problematic issues with
such a simulation technique and then suggest some approaches to addressing
these issues in Haskell.

  TITLE = {Dynamic Software Updating},

  YEAR = 2001,
  PAGES = {13--23},
  PUBLISHER = {{ACM}},
  ABSTRACT = {
Many important applications must run continuously and without interruption,
yet must be changed to fix bugs or upgrade functionality.  No
prior general-purpose methodology for dynamic updating achieves a practical
balance between flexibility, robustness, low overhead, and ease of use.

We present a new approach for C-like languages that provides type-safe
dynamic updating of native code in an extremely flexible manner (code, data,
and types may be updated, at programmer-determined times) and permits the
use of automated tools to aid the programmer in the updating process.  Our
system is based on \emph{dynamic patches} that both contain the updated code
and the code needed to transition from the old version to the new.  A novel
aspect of our patches is that they consist of \emph{verifiable native code}
(\emph{e.g.} Proof-Carrying Code~\cite{necula:pcc} or Typed Assembly
Language~\cite{morrisett+:tal}), which is native code accompanied by
annotations that allow on-line verification of the code's safety.  We
discuss how patches are generated mostly automatically, how they are applied
using dynamic-linking technology, and how code is compiled to make it
updateable.

To concretely illustrate our system, we have implemented a
dynamically-updateable web server, FlashEd.  We discuss our experience
building and maintaining FlashEd.  Performance experiments show that for
FlashEd, the overhead due to updating is typically less than 1 percent.

  ABSTRACT =	 {This paper describes the semantics of Quantum, a
                  language that was specifically designed to control
                  resource consumption of distributed computations,
                  such as mobile agent style applications. In Quantum,
                  computations can be driven by mastering their
                  resource consumption. Resources can be understood as
                  processors cycles, geographical expansion, bandwidth
                  or duration of communications, etc. We adopt a
                  generic view by saying that computations need energy
                  to be performed. Quantum relies on three new
                  primitives that deal with energy. The first
                  primitive creates a tank of energy associated with a
                  computation. Asynchronous notifications inform the
                  user of energy exhaustion and computation
                  termination. The other two primitives allow us to
                  implement suspension and resumption of computations
                  by emptying a tank and by supplying more energy to a
                  tank. The semantics takes the form of an abstract
                  machine with explicit parallelism and energy-related
                  primitives.}

  ABSTRACT = {
Run-time type analysis allows programmers to easily and concisely define
operations based upon type structure, such as serialization, iterators,
and structural equality.  However, when types can be inspected at run
time, nothing is secret.  A module writer cannot use type abstraction
to hide implementation details from clients: clients can determine the
structure of these supposedly ``abstract'' data types.  Furthermore,
access control mechanisms do not help isolate the implementation of
abstract datatypes from their clients.  Buggy or malicious authorized
modules may leak type information to unauthorized clients, so module
implementors cannot reliably tell which parts of a program rely on their
type definitions.

Currently, module implementors rely on parametric polymorphism to provide
integrity and confidentiality guarantees about their abstract datatypes.
However, standard parametricity does not hold for languages with run-time
type analysis; this paper shows how to generalize parametricity so
that it does.   The key is to augment the type system with annotations
about information-flow.  Implementors can then easily see which parts
of a program depend on the chosen implementation by tracking the flow
of dynamic type information.

@inproceedings{andersson+:fastandloose,
    abstract = {Functional programmers often reason about programs as if they were written in a total language, expecting the results to carry over to non-total (partial) languages. We justify such reasoning.Two languages are defined, one total and one partial, with identical syntax. The semantics of the partial language includes partial and infinite values, and all types are lifted, including the function spaces. A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the domain of which is the total subset of the partial language. For types not containing function spaces the PER relates equal values, and functions are related if they map related values to related values.It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the total language, then they have related semantics in the partial language. It is also shown that the PER gives rise to a bicartesian closed category which can be used to reason about values in the domain of the relation.},

  title = 	 {Gradual Typing with Unification-based Inference},
  booktitle =	 {Dynamic Languages Symposium},
  abstract = {Static and dynamic type systems have well-known strengths and
weaknesses. Gradual typing provides the benefits of both in a
single language by giving the programmer control over which portions
of the program are statically checked based on the presence or absence
of type annotations.  This paper studies the combination of gradual
typing and unification-based type inference with the goal of
developing a system that helps programmers increase the amount of
static checking in their program.  The key question in combining
gradual typing and type inference is how should the dynamic type of a
gradual system interact with the type variables of a type inference
system. This paper explores the design space and shows why three
straightforward approaches fail to meet our design goals.  This paper
presents a new type system based on the idea that a solution for a
type variable should be as informative as any type that constrains the
variable.  The paper also develops an efficient inference algorithm
and proves it sound and complete with respect to the type system.
