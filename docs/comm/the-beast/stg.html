    <h1>The GHC Commentary - You Got Control: The STG-language</h1>
    <p>
      GHC contains two completely independent backends: the byte code
      generator and the machine code generator.  The decision over which of
      the two is invoked is made in <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/main/HscMain.lhs"><code>HscMain</code></a><code>.hscCodeGen</code>.
      The machine code generator proceeds itself in a number of phases: First,
      the <a href="desugar.html">Core</a> intermediate language is translated
      into <em>STG-language</em>; second, STG-language is transformed into a
      GHC-internal variant of <a href="http://www.cminusminus.org/">C--</a>;
      and thirdly, this is either emitted as concrete C--, converted to GNU C,
      or translated to native code (by the <a href="ncg.html">native code
      generator</a> which targets IA32, Sparc, and PowerPC [as of March '5]).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following, we will have a look at the first step of machine code
      generation, namely the translation steps involving the STG-language.
      Details about the underlying abstract machine, the <em>Spineless Tagless
      G-machine</em>, are in <a
      href="http://research.microsoft.com/copyright/accept.asp?path=/users/simonpj/papers/spineless-tagless-gmachine.ps.gz&pub=34">Implementing
      lazy functional languages on stock hardware: the Spineless Tagless
      G-machine</a>, SL Peyton Jones, Journal of Functional Programming 2(2),
      Apr 1992, pp127-202. (Some details have changed since the publication of
      this article, but it still gives a good introduction to the main
      concepts.)
    </p>

    <h2>The STG Language</h2>
    <p>
      The AST of the STG-language and the generation of STG code from Core is
      both located in the <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/"><code>stgSyn/</code></a>
      directory; in the modules <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/StgSyn.lhs"><code>StgSyn</code></a>
      and <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/CoreToStg.lhs"><code>CoreToStg</code></a>,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceptually, the STG-language is a lambda calculus (including data
      constructors and case expressions) whose syntax is restricted to make
      all control flow explicit.  As such, it can be regarded as a variant of
      <em>administrative normal form (ANF).</em> (C.f., <a
      href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/173262.155113">The essence of compiling
      with continuations.</a> Cormac Flanagan, Amr Sabry, Bruce F. Duba, and
      Matthias Felleisen. <em>ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language
	Design and Implementation,</em> ACM Press, 1993.)  Each syntactic from
      has a precise operational interpretation, in addition to the
      denotational interpretation inherited from the lambda calculus.  The
      concrete representation of the STG language inside GHC also includes
      auxiliary attributes, such as <em>static reference tables (SRTs),</em>
      which determine the top-level bindings referenced by each let binding
      and case expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual in ANF, arguments to functions etc. are restricted to atoms
      (i.e., constants or variables), which implies that all sub-expressions
      are explicitly named and evaluation order is explicit.  Specific to the
      STG language is that all let bindings correspond to closure allocation
      (thunks, function closures, and data constructors) and that case
      expressions encode both computation and case selection.  There are two
      flavours of case expressions scrutinising boxed and unboxed values,
      respectively.  The former perform function calls including demanding the
      evaluation of thunks, whereas the latter execute primitive operations
      (such as arithmetic on fixed size integers and floating-point numbers).
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation of STG language defined in <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/StgSyn.lhs"><code>StgSyn</code></a>
      abstracts over both binders and occurrences of variables.  The type names
      involved in this generic definition all carry the prefix
      <code>Gen</code> (such as in <code>GenStgBinding</code>).  Instances of
      these generic definitions, where both binders and occurrences are of type
      <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/basicTypes/Id.lhs"><code>Id</code></a><code>.Id</code>
      are defined as type synonyms and use type names that drop the
      <code>Gen</code> prefix (i.e., becoming plain <code>StgBinding</code>).
      Complete programs in STG form are represented by values of type
      <code>[StgBinding]</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>From Core to STG</h2>
    <p>
      Although, the actual translation from Core AST into STG AST is performed
      by the function <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/CoreToStg.lhs"><code>CoreToStg</code></a><code>.coreToStg</code>
      (or <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/CoreToStg.lhs"><code>CoreToStg</code></a><code>.coreExprToStg</code>
      for individual expressions), the translation crucial depends on <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/coreSyn/CorePrep.lhs"><code>CorePrep</code></a><code>.corePrepPgm</code>
      (resp. <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/coreSyn/CorePrep.lhs"><code>CorePrep</code></a><code>.corePrepExpr</code>),
      which prepares Core code for code generation (for both byte code and
      machine code generation).  <code>CorePrep</code> saturates primitive and
      constructor applications, turns the code into A-normal form, renames all
      identifiers into globally unique names, generates bindings for
      constructor workers, constructor wrappers, and record selectors plus
      some further cleanup.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, after Core code is prepared for code generation it is
      structurally already in the form required by the STG language.  The main
      work performed by the actual transformation from Core to STG, as
      performed by <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/CoreToStg.lhs"><code>CoreToStg</code></a><code>.coreToStg</code>,
      is to compute the live and free variables as well as live CAFs (constant
      applicative forms) at each let binding and case alternative.  In
      subsequent phases, the live CAF information is used to compute SRTs.
      The live variable information is used to determine which stack slots
      need to be zapped (to avoid space leaks) and the free variable
      information is need to construct closures.  Moreover, hints for
      optimised code generation are computed, such as whether a closure needs
      to be updated after is has been evaluated.
    </p>

    <h2>STG Passes</h2>
    <p>
      These days little actual work is performed on programs in STG form; in
      particular, the code is not further optimised.  All serious optimisation
      (except low-level optimisations which are performed during native code
      generation) has already been done on Core.  The main task of <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/stgSyn/CoreToStg.lhs"><code>CoreToStg</code></a><code>.stg2stg</code>
      is to compute SRTs from the live CAF information determined during STG
      generation.  Other than that, <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/profiling/SCCfinal.lhs"><code>SCCfinal</code></a><code>.stgMassageForProfiling</code>
      is executed when compiling for profiling and information may be dumped
      for debugging purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Towards C--</h2>
    <p>
      GHC's internal form of C-- is defined in the module <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/cmm/Cmm.hs"><code>Cmm</code></a>.
      The definition is generic in that it abstracts over the type of static
      data and of the contents of basic blocks (i.e., over the concrete
      representation of constant data and instructions).  These generic
      definitions have names carrying the prefix <code>Gen</code> (such as
      <code>GenCmm</code>).  The same module also instantiates the generic
      form to a concrete form where data is represented by
      <code>CmmStatic</code> and instructions are represented by
      <code>CmmStmt</code> (giving us, e.g., <code>Cmm</code> from
      <code>GenCmm</code>).  The concrete form more or less follows the
      external <a href="http://www.cminusminus.org/">C--</a> language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programs in STG form are translated to <code>Cmm</code> by <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/codeGen/CodeGen.lhs"><code>CodeGen</code></a><code>.codeGen</code>
    </p>
