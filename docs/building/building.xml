<title>Building the Glasgow Functional Programming Tools Suite</title>
<author><othername>The GHC Team</othername></author>
<address><email>glasgow-haskell-&lcub;users,bugs&rcub;@haskell.org</email></address>

    <abstract>
      <para>The Glasgow fptools suite is a collection of Functional
      Programming related tools, including the Glasgow Haskell
      Compiler (GHC).  The source code for the whole suite is kept in
      a single CVS repository and shares a common build and
      installation system.</para>

      <para>This guide is intended for people who want to build or
      modify programs from the Glasgow <literal>fptools</literal>
      suite (as distinct from those who merely want to
      <emphasis>run</emphasis> them). Installation instructions are
      now provided in the user guide.</para>

      <para>The bulk of this guide applies to building on Unix
      systems; see <xref linkend="winbuild"/> for Windows notes.</para>

  <sect1 id="sec-getting">
    <title>Getting the sources</title>
    
    <para>You can get your hands on the <literal>fptools</literal>
    in two ways:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><indexterm><primary>Source
	distributions</primary></indexterm>Source distributions</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>You have a supported platform, but (a)&nbsp;you like
          the warm fuzzy feeling of compiling things yourself;
          (b)&nbsp;you want to build something ``extra&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., a
          set of libraries with strictness-analysis turned off; or
          (c)&nbsp;you want to hack on GHC yourself.</para>

	  <para>A source distribution contains complete sources for
          one or more projects in the <literal>fptools</literal>
          suite.  Not only that, but the more awkward
          machine-independent steps are done for you.  For example, if
          you don't have
          <command>happy</command><indexterm><primary>happy</primary></indexterm>
          you'll find it convenient that the source distribution
          contains the result of running <command>happy</command> on
          the parser specifications.  If you don't want to alter the
          parser then this saves you having to find and install
          <command>happy</command>. You will still need a working
          version of GHC (version 5.x or later) on your machine in
          order to compile (most of) the sources, however.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The CVS repository.<indexterm><primary>CVS repository</primary></indexterm></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>We make releases infrequently.  If you want more
          up-to-the minute (but less tested) source code then you need
          to get access to our CVS repository.</para>

	  <para>All the <literal>fptools</literal> source code is held
          in a CVS repository. CVS is a pretty good source-code
          control system, and best of all it works over the
          network.</para>

	  <para>The repository holds source code only. It holds no
          mechanically generated files at all.  So if you check out a
          source tree from CVS you will need to install every utility
          so that you can build all the derived files from
          scratch.</para>

	  <para>More information about our CVS repository can be found
          in <xref linkend="sec-cvs"/>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>If you are going to do any building from sources (either
    from a source distribution or the CVS repository) then you need to
    read all of this manual in detail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="sec-cvs">
    <title>Using the CVS repository</title>

    <para>We use <ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</ulink> (Concurrent Version System) to keep track of our
    sources for various software projects. CVS lets several people
    work on the same software at the same time, allowing changes to be
    checked in incrementally. </para>

    <para>This section is a set of guidelines for how to use our CVS
    repository, and will probably evolve in time. The main thing to
    remember is that most mistakes can be undone, but if there's
    anything you're not sure about feel free to bug the local CVS
    meister (namely Jeff Lewis
    <email>jlewis@galois.com</email>). </para>

    <sect2 id="cvs-access">
      <title>Getting access to the CVS Repository</title>

      <para>You can access the repository in one of two ways:
      read-only (<xref linkend="cvs-read-only"/>), or read-write (<xref
      linkend="cvs-read-write"/>).</para>

      <sect3 id="cvs-read-only">
	<title>Remote Read-only CVS Access</title>

	<para>Read-only access is available to anyone - there's no
        need to ask us first.  With read-only CVS access you can do
        anything except commit changes to the repository.  You can
        make changes to your local tree, and still use CVS's merge
        facility to keep your tree up to date, and you can generate
        patches using 'cvs diff' in order to send to us for
        inclusion. </para>

	<para>To get read-only access to the repository:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Make sure that <application>cvs</application> is
            installed on your machine.</para>
	  </listitem>

	    <para>Set your <literal>$CVSROOT</literal> environment variable to
            <literal>:pserver:anoncvs@glass.cse.ogi.edu:/cvs</literal></para>
	    <para>If you set <literal>$CVSROOT</literal> in a shell script, be sure not to
	      have any trailing spaces on that line, otherwise CVS will respond with 
	      a perplexing message like
	      <screen>/cvs : no such repository</screen></para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
            <para>Run the command</para>
<screen>$ cvs login</screen>
	    <para>The password is simply <literal>cvs</literal>.  This
            sets up a file in your home directory called
            <literal>.cvspass</literal>, which squirrels away the
            dummy password, so you only need to do this step once.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Now go to <xref linkend="cvs-first"/>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="cvs-read-write">
	<title>Remote Read-Write CVS Access</title>

	<para>We generally supply read-write access to folk doing
        serious development on some part of the source tree, when
        going through us would be a pain. If you're developing some
        feature, or think you have the time and inclination to fix
        bugs in our sources, feel free to ask for read-write
        access. There is a certain amount of responsibility that goes
        with commit privileges; we are more likely to grant you access
        if you've demonstrated your competence by sending us patches
        via mail in the past.</para>

	<para>To get remote read-write CVS access, you need to do the
	following steps.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Make sure that <literal>cvs</literal> and
            <literal>ssh</literal> are both installed on your
            machine.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Generate a DSA private-key/public-key pair, thus:</para>
<screen>$ ssh-keygen -d</screen>
	    <para>(<literal>ssh-keygen</literal> comes with
            <literal>ssh</literal>.)  Running <literal>ssh-keygen
            -d</literal> creates the private and public keys in
            <literal>$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa</literal> and
            <literal>$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</literal> respectively
            (assuming you accept the standard defaults).</para>

	    <para><literal>ssh-keygen -d</literal> will only work if
            you have Version 2 <literal>ssh</literal> installed; it
            will fail harmlessly otherwise.  If you only have Version
            1 you can instead generate an RSA key pair using plain</para>
<screen>$ ssh-keygen</screen>

	    <para>Doing so creates the private and public RSA keys in
            <literal>$HOME/.ssh/identity</literal> and
            <literal>$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub</literal>
            respectively.</para>

            <para>[Deprecated.]  Incidentally, you can force a Version
            2 <literal>ssh</literal> to use the Version 1 protocol by
            creating <literal>$HOME/config</literal> with the
            following in it:</para>
<programlisting>BatchMode Yes

Host cvs.haskell.org
Protocol 1</programlisting>

	    <para>In both cases, <literal>ssh-keygen</literal> will
            ask for a <firstterm>passphrase</firstterm>.  The
            passphrase is a password that protects your private key.
            In response to the 'Enter passphrase' question, you can
            either:</para>
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>[Recommended.]  Enter a passphrase, which you
                will quote each time you use CVS.
                <literal>ssh-agent</literal> makes this entirely
                un-tiresome.</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>[Deprecated.] Just hit return (i.e. use an empty
                passphrase); then you won't need to quote the
                passphrase when using CVS.  The downside is that
                anyone who can see into your <literal>.ssh</literal>
                directory, and thereby get your private key, can mess
                up the repository.  So you must keep the
                <literal>.ssh</literal> directory with draconian
                no-access permissions.</para>

      <title>Checking Out a Source Tree</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Make sure you set your <literal>CVSROOT</literal>
          environment variable according to either of the remote
          methods above. The Approved Way to check out a source tree
          is as follows:</para>

<screen>$ cvs checkout fpconfig</screen>

	  <para>At this point you have a new directory called
          <literal>fptools</literal> which contains the basic stuff
          for the fptools suite, including the configuration files and
          some other junk. </para>

<para>[Windows users.]  The following messages appear to be harmless:
<screen>setsockopt IPTOS_LOWDELAY: Invalid argument
setsockopt IPTOS_THROUGHPUT: Invalid argument</screen>
</para>


	  <para>You can call the fptools directory whatever you like,
          CVS won't mind: </para>
	  
<screen>$ mv fptools <replaceable>directory</replaceable></screen>

	  <para> NB: after you've read the CVS manual you might be
          tempted to try</para>
<screen>$ cvs checkout -d <replaceable>directory</replaceable> fpconfig</screen>

	  <para>instead of checking out <literal>fpconfig</literal>
          and then renaming it.  But this doesn't work, and will
          result in checking out the entire repository instead of just
          the <literal>fpconfig</literal> bit.</para>
<screen>$ cd <replaceable>directory</replaceable>
$ cvs checkout ghc hslibs libraries</screen>

	  <para>The second command here checks out the relevant
          modules you want to work on. For a GHC build, for instance,
          you need at least the <literal>ghc</literal>,
          <literal>hslibs</literal> and <literal>libraries</literal>
          modules (for a full list of the projects available, see
          <xref linkend="projects"/>).</para>

	  <para>Remember that if you do not have
          <literal>happy</literal> and/or <literal>Alex</literal>
          installed, you need to check them out as well.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="cvs-committing">
      <title>Committing Changes</title>

      <para>This is only if you have read-write access to the
      repository. For anoncvs users, CVS will issue a &quot;read-only
      repository&quot; error if you try to commit changes.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Build the software, if necessary. Unless you're just

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Make changes. Preferably small ones first.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Test them. You can see exactly what changes you've
          made by using the <literal>cvs diff</literal> command:</para>
<screen>$ cvs diff</screen>
	  <para>lists all the changes (using the
          <literal>diff</literal> command) in and below the current
          directory. In emacs, <literal>C-c C-v =</literal> runs
          <literal>cvs diff</literal> on the current buffer and shows
          you the results.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you changed something in the 
          <literal>fptools/libraries</literal> subdirectories, also run
          <literal>make html</literal> to check if the documentation can
          be generated successfully, too.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Before checking in a change, you need to update your
          source tree:</para>

<screen>$ cd fptools
$ cvs update</screen>
	  <para>This pulls in any changes that other people have made,
          and merges them with yours. If there are any conflicts, CVS
          will tell you, and you'll have to resolve them before you
          can check your changes in. The documentation describes what
          to do in the event of a conflict.</para>

	  <para>It's not always necessary to do a full cvs update
          before checking in a change, since CVS will always tell you
          if you try to check in a file that someone else has changed.
          However, you should still update at regular intervals to
          avoid making changes that don't work in conjuction with
          changes that someone else made. Keeping an eye on what goes
          by on the mailing list can help here.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>When you're happy that your change isn't going to
          break anything, check it in. For a one-file change:</para>

<screen>$ cvs commit <replaceable>filename</replaceable></screen>

	  <para>CVS will then pop up an editor for you to enter a
          &quot;commit message&quot;, this is just a short description
          of what your change does, and will be kept in the history of
          the file.</para>

	  <para>If you're using emacs, simply load up the file into a
          buffer and type <literal>C-x C-q</literal>, and emacs will
          prompt for a commit message and then check in the file for
          you.</para>

	  <para>For a multiple-file change, things are a bit
          trickier. There are several ways to do this, but this is the
          way I find easiest. First type the commit message into a
          temporary file. Then either</para>

<screen>$ cvs commit -F <replaceable>commit-message</replaceable> <replaceable>file_1</replaceable> .... <replaceable>file_n</replaceable></screen>

	  <para>or, if nothing else has changed in this part of the
          source tree, </para>

<screen>$ cvs commit -F <replaceable>commit-message</replaceable> <replaceable>directory</replaceable></screen>

          <para>where <replaceable>directory</replaceable> is a common
          parent directory for all your changes, and
          <replaceable>commit-message</replaceable> is the name of the
          file containing the commit message.</para>

	  <para>Shortly afterwards, you'll get some mail from the
          relevant mailing list saying which files changed, and giving
          the commit message. For a multiple-file change, you should
          still get only <emphasis>one</emphasis> message.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="cvs-update">
      <title>Updating Your Source Tree</title>

      <para>It can be tempting to cvs update just part of a source
      tree to bring in some changes that someone else has made, or
      before committing your own changes. This is NOT RECOMMENDED!
      Quite often changes in one part of the tree are dependent on
      changes in another part of the tree (the
      <literal>mk/*.mk</literal> files are a good example where
      problems crop up quite often). Having an inconsistent tree is a
      major cause of headaches. </para>

      <para>So, to avoid a lot of hassle, follow this recipe for
      updating your tree:</para>

<screen>$ cd fptools
$ cvs update -P 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log</screen>

      <para>Look at the log file, and fix any conflicts (denoted by a
      <quote>C</quote> in the first column).  New directories may have
      appeared in the repository; CVS doesn't check these out by
      default, so to get new directories you have to explicitly do
<screen>$ cvs update -d</screen>
      in each project subdirectory.  Don't do this at the top level,
      because then <emphasis>all</emphasis> the projects will be

      <title>GHC Tag Policy</title>

      <para>If you want to check out a particular version of GHC,
      you'll need to know how we tag versions in the repository.  The
      policy (as of 4.04) is:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The tree is branched before every major release.  The
          branch tag is <literal>ghc-x-xx-branch</literal>, where
          <literal>x-xx</literal> is the version number of the release
          with the <literal>'.'</literal> replaced by a
          <literal>'-'</literal>.  For example, the 4.04 release lives
          on <literal>ghc-4-04-branch</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The release itself is tagged with
          <literal>ghc-x-xx</literal> (on the branch).  eg. 4.06 is
          called <literal>ghc-4-06</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>We didn't always follow these guidelines, so to see
          what tags there are for previous versions, do <literal>cvs
          log</literal> on a file that's been around for a while (like
          <literal>fptools/ghc/README</literal>).</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>So, to check out a fresh GHC 4.06 tree you would
      do:</para>

<screen>$ cvs co -r ghc-4-06 fpconfig
$ cd fptools
$ cvs co -r ghc-4-06 ghc hslibs</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="cvs-hints">
      <title>General Hints</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>As a general rule: commit changes in small units,
          preferably addressing one issue or implementing a single
          feature.  Provide a descriptive log message so that the
          repository records exactly which changes were required to
          implement a given feature/fix a bug. I've found this
          <emphasis>very</emphasis> useful in the past for finding out
          when a particular bug was introduced: you can just wind back
          the CVS tree until the bug disappears.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Keep the sources at least *buildable* at any given
          time. No doubt bugs will creep in, but it's quite easy to
          ensure that any change made at least leaves the tree in a
          buildable state. We do nightly builds of GHC to keep an eye
          on what things work/don't work each day and how we're doing
          in relation to previous verions. This idea is truely wrecked
          if the compiler won't build in the first place!</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>To check out extra bits into an already-checked-out
          tree, use the following procedure.  Suppose you have a
          checked-out fptools tree containing just ghc, and you want
          to add nofib to it:</para>

<screen>$ cd fptools
$ cvs checkout nofib</screen>

	  <para>or: </para>

<screen>$ cd fptools
$ cvs update -d nofib</screen>
	  
	  <para>(the -d flag tells update to create a new
          directory). If you just want part of the nofib suite, you
          can do </para>

<screen>$ cd fptools
$ cvs checkout nofib/spectral</screen>

	  <para>This works because <literal>nofib</literal> is a
          module in its own right, and spectral is a subdirectory of
          the nofib module. The path argument to checkout must always
          start with a module name. There's no equivalent form of this
          command using <literal>update</literal>.</para>

    <para>The <literal>fptools</literal> suite consists of several

      <para>If you just want to build the software once on a single
      platform, then your source tree can also be your build tree, and
      you can skip the rest of this section.</para>

      <para>We often want to build multiple versions of our software
      for different architectures, or with different options
      (e.g. profiling).  It's very desirable to share a single copy of
      the source code among all these builds.</para>

      <para>So for every source tree we have zero or more
      <emphasis>build trees</emphasis>.  Each build tree is initially
      an exact copy of the source tree, except that each file is a
      symbolic link to the source file, rather than being a copy of
      the source file.  There are &ldquo;standard&rdquo; Unix
      utilities that make such copies, so standard that they go by
      different names:
      <command>lndir</command><indexterm><primary>lndir</primary></indexterm>,
      <command>mkshadowdir</command><indexterm><primary>mkshadowdir</primary></indexterm>
      are two (If you don't have either, the source distribution
      includes sources for the X11
      <command>lndir</command>&mdash;check out
      <filename>fptools/glafp-utils/lndir</filename>). See <xref
      linkend="sec-storysofar"/> for a typical invocation.</para>

      <para>The build tree does not need to be anywhere near the
      source tree in the file system.  Indeed, one advantage of
      separating the build tree from the source is that the build tree
      can be placed in a non-backed-up partition, saving your systems
      support people from backing up untold megabytes of
      easily-regenerated, and rapidly-changing, gubbins.  The golden
      rule is that (with a single exception&mdash;<xref
      linkend="sec-build-config"/>) <emphasis>absolutely everything in
      the build tree is either a symbolic link to the source tree, or
      else is mechanically generated</emphasis>.  It should be
      perfectly OK for your build tree to vanish overnight; an hour or
      two compiling and you're on the road again.</para>

      <para>You need to be a bit careful, though, that any new files
      you create (if you do any development work) are in the source
      tree, not a build tree!</para>

      <para>Remember, that the source files in the build tree are
      <emphasis>symbolic links</emphasis> to the files in the source
      tree.  (The build tree soon accumulates lots of built files like
      <filename>Foo.o</filename>, as well.)  You can
      <emphasis>delete</emphasis> a source file from the build tree
      without affecting the source tree (though it's an odd thing to
      do).  On the other hand, if you <emphasis>edit</emphasis> a
      source file from the build tree, you'll edit the source-tree
      file directly.  (You can set up Emacs so that if you edit a
      source file from the build tree, Emacs will silently create an
      edited copy of the source file in the build tree, leaving the
      source file unchanged; but the danger is that you think you've
      edited the source file whereas actually all you've done is edit
      the build-tree copy.  More commonly you do want to edit the
      source file.)</para>

      <para>Like the source tree, the top level of your build tree
      must be (a linked copy of) the root directory of the
      <literal>fptools</literal> suite.  Inside Makefiles, the root of
      your build tree is called
      <constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</constant><indexterm><primary>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP</primary></indexterm>.
      In the rest of this document path names are relative to
      <constant>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)</constant> unless
      otherwise stated.  For example, the file
      <filename>ghc/mk/target.mk</filename> is actually

	  <term>Step 3: build configuration.</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Next, you say how this build of
            <literal>fptools</literal> is to differ from the standard
            defaults by creating a new file
            <filename>mk/build.mk</filename><indexterm><primary>build.mk</primary></indexterm>
            <emphasis>in the build tree</emphasis>.  This file is the
            one and only file you edit in the build tree, precisely
            because it says how this build differs from the source.
            (Just in case your build tree does die, you might want to
            keep a private directory of <filename>build.mk</filename>
            files, and use a symbolic link in each build tree to point
            to the appropriate one.)  So
            <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> never exists in the
            source tree&mdash;you create one in each build tree from
            the template.  We'll discuss what to put in it
            shortly.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>And that's it for configuration. Simple, eh?</para>

      <para>What do you put in your build-specific configuration file
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename>?  <emphasis>For almost all
      purposes all you will do is put make variable definitions that
      override those in</emphasis>
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>.  The whole point of
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>&mdash;and its derived
      counterpart <filename>mk/config.mk</filename>&mdash;is to define
      the build configuration. It is heavily commented, as you will
      see if you look at it.  So generally, what you do is look at
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>, and add definitions in
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> that override any of the
      <filename>config.mk</filename> definitions that you want to
      change.  (The override occurs because the main boilerplate file,
      <filename>mk/boilerplate.mk</filename><indexterm><primary>boilerplate.mk</primary></indexterm>,
      includes <filename>build.mk</filename> after
      <filename>config.mk</filename>.)</para>

     <para>For your convenience, there's a file called <filename>build.mk.sample</filename>
     that can serve as a starting point for your <filename>build.mk</filename>.</para>

      <para>For example, <filename>config.mk.in</filename> contains
      the definition:</para>

<programlisting>GhcHcOpts=-O -Rghc-timing</programlisting>

      <para>The accompanying comment explains that this is the list of
      flags passed to GHC when building GHC itself.  For doing
      development, it is wise to add <literal>-DDEBUG</literal>, to
      enable debugging code.  So you would add the following to
      <filename>build.mk</filename>:</para>
      
      <para>or, if you prefer,</para>

<programlisting>GhcHcOpts += -DDEBUG</programlisting>

      <para>GNU <command>make</command> allows existing definitions to
      have new text appended using the &ldquo;<literal>+=</literal>&rdquo;
      operator, which is quite a convenient feature.)</para>

      <para>If you want to remove the <literal>-O</literal> as well (a
      good idea when developing, because the turn-around cycle gets a
      lot quicker), you can just override
      <literal>GhcLibHcOpts</literal> altogether:</para>

<programlisting>GhcHcOpts=-DDEBUG -Rghc-timing</programlisting>

      <para>When reading <filename>config.mk.in</filename>, remember
      that anything between &ldquo;@...@&rdquo; signs is going to be substituted
      by <command>configure</command> later.  You
      <emphasis>can</emphasis> override the resulting definition if
      you want, but you need to be a bit surer what you are doing.
      For example, there's a line that says:</para>

<programlisting>TAR = @TarCmd@</programlisting>

      <para>This defines the Make variables <constant>TAR</constant>
      to the pathname for a <command>tar</command> that
      <command>configure</command> finds somewhere.  If you have your
      own pet <command>tar</command> you want to use instead, that's
      fine. Just add this line to <filename>mk/build.mk</filename>:</para>

<programlisting>TAR = mytar</programlisting>

      <para>You do not <emphasis>have</emphasis> to have a
      <filename>mk/build.mk</filename> file at all; if you don't,
      you'll get all the default settings from
      <filename>mk/config.mk.in</filename>.</para>

      <para>You can also use <filename>build.mk</filename> to override
      anything that <command>configure</command> got wrong.  One place
      where this happens often is with the definition of
      <constant>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP&lowbar;ABS</constant>: this
      variable is supposed to be the canonical path to the top of your
      source tree, but if your system uses an automounter then the
      correct directory is hard to find automatically.  If you find
      that <command>configure</command> has got it wrong, just put the
      correct definition in <filename>build.mk</filename>.</para>

	  <para>(N.B. <command>mkshadowdir</command>'s first argument

      <title>Making things</title>

      <para>At this point you have made yourself a fully-configured

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="sec-bootstrapping">
      <title>Bootstrapping GHC</title>

      <para>GHC requires a 2-stage bootstrap in order to provide 
      full functionality, including GHCi.  By a 2-stage bootstrap, we
      mean that the compiler is built once using the installed GHC,
      and then again using the compiler built in the first stage.  You
      can also build a stage 3 compiler, but this normally isn't
      necessary except to verify that the stage 2 compiler is working
      properly.</para>

      <para>Note that when doing a bootstrap, the stage 1 compiler
      must be built, followed by the runtime system and libraries, and
      then the stage 2 compiler.  The correct ordering is implemented
      by the top-level fptools <filename>Makefile</filename>, so if
      you want everything to work automatically it's best to start
      <command>make</command> from the top of the tree.  When building
      GHC, the top-level fptools <filename>Makefile</filename> is set
      up to do a 2-stage bootstrap by default (when you say

      <para>Sometimes the dependencies get in the way: if you've made

      the following hack may be useful:</para>

<screen>$ gmake FAST=YES</screen>

      <para>This tells the make system to ignore dependencies and just
      build what you tell it to.  In other words, it's equivalent to

      <para>A bit of history: GHC used to come with a

      <title>A small project</title>

      <para>To get started, let us look at the
      <filename>Makefile</filename> for an imaginary small
      <literal>fptools</literal> project, <literal>small</literal>.
      Each project in <literal>fptools</literal> has its own directory
      in <constant>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP</constant>, so the
      <literal>small</literal> project will have its own directory
      <constant>FPOOLS&lowbar;TOP/small/</constant>.  Inside the
      <filename>small/</filename> directory there will be a
      <filename>Makefile</filename>, looking something like
      this:</para>

<indexterm><primary>Makefile, minimal</primary></indexterm>

<programlisting># Makefile for fptools project "small"

TOP = ..
include $(TOP)/mk/boilerplate.mk

SRCS = $(wildcard *.lhs) $(wildcard *.c)
HS_PROG = small

include $(TOP)/target.mk</programlisting>

      <para>this <filename>Makefile</filename> has three
      sections:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The first section includes
<footnote>
<para>
One of the most important
features of GNU <command>make</command> that we use is the ability for a <filename>Makefile</filename> to
include another named file, very like <command>cpp</command>'s <literal>&num;include</literal>
directive.
</para>
</footnote>

          a file of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; code from the level
          above (which in this case will be
          <filename>FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP/mk/boilerplate.mk</filename><indexterm><primary>boilerplate.mk</primary></indexterm>).
          As its name suggests, <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>
          consists of a large quantity of standard
          <filename>Makefile</filename> code.  We discuss this
          boilerplate in more detail in <xref linkend="sec-boiler"/>.
          <indexterm><primary>include, directive in
          Makefiles</primary></indexterm> <indexterm><primary>Makefile
          inclusion</primary></indexterm></para>

          <para>Before the <literal>include</literal> statement, you
          must define the <command>make</command> variable
          <constant>TOP</constant><indexterm><primary>TOP</primary></indexterm>
          to be the directory containing the <filename>mk</filename>
          directory in which the <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>
          file is.  It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> OK to simply say</para>

<programlisting>include ../mk/boilerplate.mk  # NO NO NO</programlisting>


          <para>Why?  Because the <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>
          file needs to know where it is, so that it can, in turn,
          <literal>include</literal> other files.  (Unfortunately,
          when an <literal>include</literal>d file does an
          <literal>include</literal>, the filename is treated relative
          to the directory in which <command>gmake</command> is being
          run, not the directory in which the
          <literal>include</literal>d sits.)  In general,
          <emphasis>every file <filename>foo.mk</filename> assumes
          that
          <filename>&dollar;(TOP)/mk/foo.mk</filename>
          refers to itself.</emphasis> It is up to the
          <filename>Makefile</filename> doing the
          <literal>include</literal> to ensure this is the case.</para>

          <para>Files intended for inclusion in other
          <filename>Makefile</filename>s are written to have the
          following property: <emphasis>after
          <filename>foo.mk</filename> is <literal>include</literal>d,
          it leaves <constant>TOP</constant> containing the same value
          as it had just before the <literal>include</literal>
          statement</emphasis>.  In our example, this invariant
          guarantees that the <literal>include</literal> for
          <filename>target.mk</filename> will look in the same
          directory as that for <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para> The second section defines the following standard
          <command>make</command> variables:
          <constant>SRCS</constant><indexterm><primary>SRCS</primary></indexterm>
          (the source files from which is to be built), and
          <constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</constant><indexterm><primary>HS&lowbar;PROG</primary></indexterm>
          (the executable binary to be built).  We will discuss in
          more detail what the &ldquo;standard variables&rdquo; are,
          and how they affect what happens, in <xref
          linkend="sec-targets"/>.</para>

	  <para>The definition for <constant>SRCS</constant> uses the
          useful GNU <command>make</command> construct
          <literal>&dollar;(wildcard&nbsp;$pat$)</literal><indexterm><primary>wildcard</primary></indexterm>,
          which expands to a list of all the files matching the
          pattern <literal>pat</literal> in the current directory.  In
          this example, <constant>SRCS</constant> is set to the list
          of all the <filename>.lhs</filename> and
          <filename>.c</filename> files in the directory.  (Let's
          suppose there is one of each, <filename>Foo.lhs</filename>
          and <filename>Baz.c</filename>.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The last section includes a second file of standard
          code, called
          <filename>target.mk</filename><indexterm><primary>target.mk</primary></indexterm>.
          It contains the rules that tell <command>gmake</command> how
          to make the standard targets (<xref
          linkend="sec-standard-targets"/>).  Why, you ask, can't this
          standard code be part of
          <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>?  Good question.  We
          discuss the reason later, in <xref
          linkend="sec-boiler-arch"/>.</para>

          <para>You do not <emphasis>have</emphasis> to
          <literal>include</literal> the
          <filename>target.mk</filename> file.  Instead, you can write
          rules of your own for all the standard targets.  Usually,
          though, you will find quite a big payoff from using the
          canned rules in <filename>target.mk</filename>; the price
          tag is that you have to understand what canned rules get
          enabled, and what they do (<xref
          linkend="sec-targets"/>).</para>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>In our example <filename>Makefile</filename>, most of the
      work is done by the two <literal>include</literal>d files.  When

	  <para>It uses a boilerplate pattern rule to compile

          build configuration.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It uses another standard pattern rule to compile
          <filename>Baz.c</filename> to <filename>Baz.o</filename>,
          using a C compiler.  (Ditto.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It links the resulting <filename>.o</filename> files
          together to make <literal>small</literal>, using the Haskell
          compiler to do the link step.  (Why not use
          <command>ld</command>?  Because the Haskell compiler knows
          what standard libraries to link in.  How did
          <command>gmake</command> know to use the Haskell compiler to
          do the link, rather than the C compiler?  Because we set the
          variable <constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</constant> rather than
          <constant>C&lowbar;PROG</constant>.)</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>All <filename>Makefile</filename>s should follow the above
      three-section format.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>A larger project</title>

      <para>Larger projects are usually structured into a number of
      sub-directories, each of which has its own
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  (In very large projects, this
      sub-structure might be iterated recursively, though that is
      rare.)  To give you the idea, here's part of the directory
      structure for the (rather large) GHC project:</para>

<programlisting>$(FPTOOLS_TOP)/ghc/
  Makefile
  mk/
    boilerplate.mk
    rules.mk
   docs/
    Makefile
    ...source files for documentation...
   driver/
    Makefile
    ...source files for driver...
   compiler/
    Makefile
    parser/...source files for parser...
    renamer/...source files for renamer...
    ...etc...</programlisting>

      <para>The sub-directories <filename>docs</filename>,
      <filename>driver</filename>, <filename>compiler</filename>, and
      so on, each contains a sub-component of GHC, and each has its
      own <filename>Makefile</filename>.  There must also be a
      <filename>Makefile</filename> in
      <filename>&dollar;(FPTOOLS&lowbar;TOP)/ghc</filename>.
      It does most of its work by recursively invoking
      <command>gmake</command> on the <filename>Makefile</filename>s
      in the sub-directories.  We say that
      <filename>ghc/Makefile</filename> is a <emphasis>non-leaf
      <filename>Makefile</filename></emphasis>, because it does little
      except organise its children, while the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the sub-directories are all
      <emphasis>leaf <filename>Makefile</filename>s</emphasis>.  (In
      principle the sub-directories might themselves contain a
      non-leaf <filename>Makefile</filename> and several
      sub-sub-directories, but that does not happen in GHC.)</para>

      <para>The <filename>Makefile</filename> in
      <filename>ghc/compiler</filename> is considered a leaf
      <filename>Makefile</filename> even though the
      <filename>ghc/compiler</filename> has sub-directories, because
      these sub-directories do not themselves have
      <filename>Makefile</filename>s in them.  They are just used to
      structure the collection of modules that make up GHC, but all
      are managed by the single <filename>Makefile</filename> in
      <filename>ghc/compiler</filename>.</para>

      <para>You will notice that <filename>ghc/</filename> also
      contains a directory <filename>ghc/mk/</filename>.  It contains
      GHC-specific <filename>Makefile</filename> boilerplate code.
      More precisely:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><filename>ghc/mk/boilerplate.mk</filename> is included
          at the top of <filename>ghc/Makefile</filename>, and of all
          the leaf <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the
          sub-directories.  It in turn <literal>include</literal>s the
          main boilerplate file
          <filename>mk/boilerplate.mk</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><filename>ghc/mk/target.mk</filename> is
          <literal>include</literal>d at the bottom of
          <filename>ghc/Makefile</filename>, and of all the leaf
          <filename>Makefile</filename>s in the sub-directories.  It
          in turn <literal>include</literal>s the file
          <filename>mk/target.mk</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      customisation of the standard boilerplate.</para>

          described in <xref linkend="sec-standard-targets"/>.  These
          rules are selectively included, depending on the setting of
          certain <command>make</command> variables.  These variables
          are usually set in the middle section of the

	  <para><filename>target.mk</filename> must be included at the
          end (rather than being part of
          <filename>boilerplate.mk</filename>) for several tiresome
          reasons:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>

	      <para><command>gmake</command> commits target and
              dependency lists earlier than it should.  For example,
              <filename>target.mk</filename> has a rule that looks
              like this:</para>

<programlisting>$(HS_PROG) : $(OBJS)
      $(HC) $(LD_OPTS) $&#60; -o $@</programlisting>

	      <para>If this rule was in

              and
              <constant>&dollar;(OBJS)</constant><indexterm><primary>OBJS</primary></indexterm>
              would not have their final values at the moment
              <command>gmake</command> encountered the rule.  Alas,
              <command>gmake</command> takes a snapshot of their
              current values, and wires that snapshot into the rule.
              (In contrast, the commands executed when the rule
              &ldquo;fires&rdquo; are only substituted at the moment
              of firing.)  So, the rule must follow the definitions
              given in the <filename>Makefile</filename> itself.</para>

      <title>Way management</title>
      <indexterm><primary>way management</primary></indexterm>

      <para>We sometimes want to build essentially the same system in
      several different &ldquo;ways&rdquo;.  For example, we want to build GHC's
      <literal>Prelude</literal> libraries with and without profiling,
      so that there is an appropriately-built library archive to link
      with when the user compiles his program.  It would be possible
      to have a completely separate build tree for each such &ldquo;way&rdquo;,
      but it would be horribly bureaucratic, especially since often
      only parts of the build tree need to be constructed in multiple
      ways.</para>

      <para>Instead, the
      <filename>target.mk</filename><indexterm><primary>target.mk</primary></indexterm>
      contains some clever magic to allow you to build several
      versions of a system; and to control locally how many versions
      are built and how they differ.  This section explains the
      magic.</para>

      <para>The files for a particular way are distinguished by
      munging the suffix.  The <quote>normal way</quote> is always
      built, and its files have the standard suffices
      <filename>.o</filename>, <filename>.hi</filename>, and so on.
      In addition, you can build one or more extra ways, each
      distinguished by a <emphasis>way tag</emphasis>.  The object
      files and interface files for one of these extra ways are
      distinguished by their suffix.  For example, way
      <literal>mp</literal> has files
      <filename>.mp&lowbar;o</filename> and
      <filename>.mp&lowbar;hi</filename>.  Library archives have their
      way tag the other side of the dot, for boring reasons; thus,
      <filename>libHS&lowbar;mp.a</filename>.</para>

      <para>A <command>make</command> variable called
      <constant>way</constant> holds the current way tag.
      <emphasis><constant>way</constant> is only ever set on the
      command line of <command>gmake</command></emphasis> (usually in
      a recursive invocation of <command>gmake</command> by the
      system).  It is never set inside a
      <filename>Makefile</filename>.  So it is a global constant for
      any one invocation of <command>gmake</command>.  Two other
      <command>make</command> variables,
      <constant>way&lowbar;</constant> and
      <constant>&lowbar;way</constant> are immediately derived from
      <constant>&dollar;(way)</constant> and never altered.  If
      <constant>way</constant> is not set, then neither are
      <constant>way&lowbar;</constant> and
      <constant>&lowbar;way</constant>, and the invocation of
      <command>make</command> will build the <quote>normal
      way</quote>.  If <constant>way</constant> is set, then the other
      two variables are set in sympathy.  For example, if
      <constant>&dollar;(way)</constant> is &ldquo;<literal>mp</literal>&rdquo;,
      then <constant>way&lowbar;</constant> is set to
      &ldquo;<literal>mp&lowbar;</literal>&rdquo; and
      <constant>&lowbar;way</constant> is set to
      &ldquo;<literal>&lowbar;mp</literal>&rdquo;.  These three variables are
      then used when constructing file names.</para>

      <para>So how does <command>make</command> ever get recursively
      invoked with <constant>way</constant> set?  There are two ways
      in which this happens:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>For some (but not all) of the standard targets, when
          in a leaf sub-directory, <command>make</command> is
          recursively invoked for each way tag in
          <constant>&dollar;(WAYS)</constant>.  You set
          <constant>WAYS</constant> in the
          <filename>Makefile</filename> to the list of way tags you
          want these targets built for.  The mechanism here is very
          much like the recursive invocation of
          <command>make</command> in sub-directories (<xref
          linkend="sec-subdirs"/>).  It is up to you to set
          <constant>WAYS</constant> in your
          <filename>Makefile</filename>; this is how you control what
          ways will get built.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>For a useful collection of targets (such as
          <filename>libHS&lowbar;mp.a</filename>,
          <filename>Foo.mp&lowbar;o</filename>) there is a rule which
          recursively invokes <command>make</command> to make the
          specified target, setting the <constant>way</constant>
          variable.  So if you say <command>gmake
          Foo.mp&lowbar;o</command> you should see a recursive
          invocation <command>gmake Foo.mp&lowbar;o way=mp</command>,
          and <emphasis>in this recursive invocation the pattern rule
          for compiling a Haskell file into a <filename>.o</filename>
          file will match</emphasis>.  The key pattern rules (in
          <filename>suffix.mk</filename>) look like this:

<programlisting>%.$(way_)o : %.lhs
      $(HC) $(HC_OPTS) $&#60; -o $@</programlisting>

          Neat, eh?</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>You can invoke <command>make</command> with a

      For example, in the <literal>nofib</literal> suite we want the
      link step to print out timing information.  The thing to do here
      is <emphasis>not</emphasis> to define
      <constant>HS&lowbar;PROG</constant> or
      <constant>C&lowbar;PROG</constant>, and instead define a special
      purpose rule in your own <filename>Makefile</filename>.  By
      using different variable names you will avoid the canned rules
      being included, and conflicting with yours.</para>

<screen>XMLDocWays = html ps</screen>

    <sect2 id="unregisterised-porting">
      <title>Porting GHC to a new architecture</title>
      
      <para>The first step in porting to a new architecture is to get
      an <firstterm>unregisterised</firstterm> build working.  An
      unregisterised build is one that compiles via vanilla C only.
      By contrast, a registerised build uses the following
      architecture-specific hacks for speed:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Global register variables: certain abstract machine
	  <quote>registers</quote> are mapped to real machine
	  registers, depending on how many machine registers are

	<listitem>
	  <para>Assembly-mangling: when compiling via C, we feed the
	  assembly generated by gcc though a Perl script known as the
	  <firstterm>mangler</firstterm> (see
	  <filename>ghc/driver/mangler/ghc-asm.lprl</filename>).  The
	  mangler rearranges the assembly to support tail-calls and
	  various other optimisations.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In an unregisterised build, neither of these hacks are
      used &mdash; the idea is that the C code generated by the
      compiler should compile using gcc only.  The lack of these
      optimisations costs about a factor of two in performance, but
      since unregisterised compilation is usually just a step on the
      way to a full registerised port, we don't mind too much.</para>

      <para>Notes on GHC portability in general: we've tried to stick
      to writing portable code in most parts of the system, so it
      should compile on any POSIXish system with gcc, but in our

	<title>Cross-compiling to produce an unregisterised GHC</title>

	<para>NOTE!  These instructions apply to GHC 6.4 and (hopefully)
	  later.  If you need instructions for an earlier version of GHC, try
	  to get hold of the version of this document that was current at the
	  time.  It should be available from the appropriate download page on
	  the <ulink
	    url="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC&nbsp;homepage</ulink>.</para>  

	<para>In this section, we explain how to bootstrap GHC on a
	new platform, using unregisterised intermediate C files.  We
	haven't put a great deal of effort into automating this
	process, for two reasons: it is done very rarely, and the
	process usually requires human intervention to cope with minor
	porting issues anyway.</para>

	<para>The following step-by-step instructions should result in
	a fully working, albeit unregisterised, GHC.  Firstly, you
	need a machine that already has a working GHC (we'll call this
	the <firstterm>host</firstterm> machine), in order to
	cross-compile the intermediate C files that we will use to
	bootstrap the compiler on the <firstterm>target</firstterm>
	machine.</para>

	    <para>At this stage we simply need to bootstrap a compiler

	    <para>However, since this is a bootstrap on a new machine,

	    <para>Don't bother with running

<para>
 If you're compiling with GHC 4.00 or later, then the

GHC is designed both to be built, and to run, on both Unix and Windows.  This flexibility

</para>

<sect2 id="cygwin-and-mingw"><title>Windows platforms: Cygwin, MSYS, and MinGW</title>

<para> The build system is built around Unix-y makefiles.  Because it's not native,
the Windows situation for building GHC is particularly confusing.  This section
tries to clarify, and to establish terminology.</para>

<sect3 id="ghc-mingw"><title>MinGW</title>

<para> <ulink url="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)</ulink> 
is a collection of header
files and import libraries that allow one to use <command>gcc</command> and produce
native Win32 programs that do not rely on any third-party DLLs. The
current set of tools include GNU Compiler Collection (<command>gcc</command>), GNU Binary
Utilities (Binutils), GNU debugger (Gdb), GNU make, and a assorted
other utilities. 
</para>

<para> The down-side of MinGW is that the MinGW libraries do not support anything like the full
Posix interface.  
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="ghc-cygwin"><title>Cygwin and MSYS</title>

<para>You can't use the MinGW to <emphasis>build</emphasis> GHC, because MinGW doesn't have a shell,
or the standard Unix commands such as <command>mv</command>, <command>rm</command>,
<command>ls</command>, nor build-system stuff such as <command>make</command> and <command>cvs</command>.
For that, there are two choices: <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</ulink> 
and <ulink url="http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml">MSYS</ulink>:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Cygwin comes with compilation tools (<command>gcc</command>, <command>ld</command> and so on), which
compile code that has access to all of Posix.  The price is that the executables must be 
dynamically linked with the Cygwin DLL, so that <emphasis>you cannot run a Cywin-compiled program on a machine
that doesn't have Cygwin</emphasis>.  Worse, Cygwin is a moving target.  The name of the main DLL, <literal>cygwin1.dll</literal>
does not change, but the implementation certainly does.  Even the interfaces to functions
it exports seem to change occasionally. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
MSYS is a fork of the Cygwin tree, so they
are fundamentally similar.  However, MSYS is by design much smaller and simpler.  Access to the file system goes
through fewer layers, so MSYS is quite a bit faster too.
</para>

<para>Furthermore, MSYS provides no compilation tools; it relies instead on the MinGW tools. These
compile binaries that run with no DLL support, on any Win32 system.
However, MSYS does come with all the make-system tools, such as <command>make</command>, <command>autoconf</command>, 
<command>cvs</command>, <command>ssh</command> etc.  To get these, you have to download the 
MsysDTK (Developer Tool Kit) package, as well as the base MSYS package.
</para>
<para>MSYS does have a DLL, but it's only used by MSYS commands (<command>sh</command>, <command>rm</command>, 
<command>ssh</command> and so on),
not by programs compiled under MSYS.
</para></listitem>

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Targeting MinGW</title>

<para>We want GHC to compile programs that work on any Win32 system.  Hence:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
GHC does invoke a C compiler, assembler, linker and so on, but we ensure that it only
invokes the MinGW tools, not the Cygwin ones.  That means that the programs GHC compiles
will work on any system, but it also means that the programs GHC compiles do not have access
to all of Posix.  In particular, they cannot import the (Haskell) Posix

their input output using standard Haskell I/O libraries, or native Win32 bindings.</para>
<para> We will call a GHC that targets MinGW in this way <emphasis>GHC-mingw</emphasis>.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
To make the GHC distribution self-contained, the GHC distribution includes the MinGW <command>gcc</command>,
<command>as</command>, <command>ld</command>, and a bunch of input/output libraries.  
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
So <emphasis>GHC targets MinGW</emphasis>, not Cygwin.
It is in principle possible to build a version of GHC, <emphasis>GHC-cygwin</emphasis>, 
that targets Cygwin instead.  The up-side of GHC-cygwin is
that Haskell programs compiled by GHC-cygwin can import the (Haskell) Posix library.
<emphasis>We do not support GHC-cygwin, however; it is beyond our resources.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>While GHC <emphasis>targets</emphasis> MinGW, that says nothing about 
how GHC is <emphasis>built</emphasis>.  We use both MSYS and Cygwin as build environments for
GHC; both work fine, though MSYS is rather lighter weight.</para>

<para>In your build tree, you build a compiler called <command>ghc-inplace</command>.  It
uses the <command>gcc</command> that you specify using the
<option>--with-gcc</option> flag when you run
<command>configure</command> (see below).
The makefiles are careful to use <command>ghc-inplace</command> (not <command>gcc</command>)
to compile any C files, so that it will in turn invoke the correct <command>gcc</command> rather that
whatever one happens to be in your path.  However, the makefiles do use whatever <command>ld</command> 
and <command>ar</command> happen to be in your path. This is a bit naughty, but (a) they are only
used to glom together .o files into a bigger .o file, or a .a file, 
so they don't ever get libraries (which would be bogus; they might be the wrong libraries), and (b)
Cygwin and MinGW use the same .o file format.  So its ok.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title> File names </title>

<para>Cygwin, MSYS, and the underlying Windows file system all understand file paths of form <literal>c:/tmp/foo</literal>.
However:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
MSYS programs understand <filename>/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, and map Windows's lettered drives as
<filename>/c/tmp/foo</filename> etc.  The exact mount table is given in the doc subdirectory of the MSYS distribution.
</para>
<para> When it invokes a command, the MSYS shell sees whether the invoked binary lives in the MSYS <filename>/bin</filename>
directory.  If so, it just invokes it.  If not, it assumes the program is no an MSYS program, and walks over the command-line
arguments changing MSYS paths into native-compatible paths.  It does this inside sub-arguments and inside quotes. For example,
if you invoke
<programlisting>foogle -B/c/tmp/baz</programlisting>
the MSYS shell will actually call <literal>foogle</literal> with argument <literal>-Bc:/tmp/baz</literal>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Cygwin programs have a more complicated mount table, and map the lettered drives as <filename>/cygdrive/c/tmp/foo</filename>.
</para>
<para>The Cygwin shell does no argument processing when invoking non-Cygwin programs.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Crippled <command>ld</command></title>

<para>
It turns out that on both Cygwin and MSYS, the <command>ld</command> has a
limit of 32kbytes on its command line.  Especially when using split object
files, the make system can emit calls to <command>ld</command> with thousands
of files on it.  Then you may see something like this:
<programlisting>
(cd Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL/GL/QueryUtils_split &amp;&amp; /mingw/bin/ld -r -x -o ../QueryUtils.o *.o)
/bin/sh: /mingw/bin/ld: Invalid argument
</programlisting>
The solution is either to switch off object file splitting (set
<option>SplitObjs</option> to <literal>NO</literal> in your
<filename>build.mk</filename>),
or to make the module smaller.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Host System vs Target System</title>

<para>
In the source code you'll find various ifdefs looking like:
<programlisting>#ifdef mingw32_HOST_OS
  ...blah blah...
#endif</programlisting>
and 
<programlisting>#ifdef mingw32_TARGET_OS
  ...blah blah...
#endif</programlisting>
These macros are set by the configure script (via the file config.h).
Which is which?  The criterion is this.  In the ifdefs in GHC's source code:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>The "host" system is the one on which GHC itself will be run.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>The "target" system is the one for which the program compiled by GHC will be run.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
For a stage-2 compiler, in which GHCi is available, the "host" and "target" systems must be the same.
So then it doesn't really matter whether you use the HOST_OS or TARGET_OS cpp macros.

</para>
</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Wrapper scripts</title>

<para>
Many programs, including GHC itself and hsc2hs, need to find associated binaries and libraries.
For <emphasis>installed</emphasis> programs, the strategy depends on the platform.  We'll use
GHC itself as an example:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem> <para>
  On Unix, the command <command>ghc</command> is a shell script, generated by adding installation
  paths to the front of the source file <filename>ghc.sh</filename>, 
  that invokes the real binary, passing "-B<emphasis>path</emphasis>" as an argument to tell <command>ghc</command>
  where to find its supporting files. 
  </para> </listitem>

  <listitem> <para>
  On vanilla Windows, it turns out to be much harder to make reliable script to be run by the
  native Windows shell <command>cmd</command> (e.g. limits on the length
   of the command line).  So instead we invoke the GHC binary directly, with no -B flag.
  GHC uses the Windows <literal>getExecDir</literal> function to find where the executable is,
  and from that figures out where the supporting files are.
  </para> </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
(You can find the layout of GHC's supporting files in the
  section "Layout of installed files" of Section 2 of the GHC user guide.)
</para>
<para>
Things work differently for <emphasis>in-place</emphasis> execution, where you want to
execute a program that has just been built in a build tree. The difference is that the
layout of the supporting files is different.
In this case, whether on Windows or Unix, we always use a shell script. This works OK
on Windows because the script is executed by MSYS or Cygwin, which don't have the
shortcomings of the native Windows <command>cmd</command> shell.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="winbuild"><title>Instructions for building under Windows</title>

</para>
<para>
Make sure you read the preceding section on platforms (<xref linkend="platforms"/>)

<sect2 id="msys-install"><title>Installing and configuring MSYS</title>

<para>
MSYS is a lightweight alternative to Cygwin.  
You don't need MSYS to <emphasis>use</emphasis> GHC,

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><literal>HOME</literal>: set to your home directory (e.g. <literal>c:/userid</literal>).
  This is where, among other things, <command>ssh</command> will look for your <literal>.ssh</literal> directory.
  </para></listitem>

  </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Check that the <literal>CYGWIN</literal> environment variable is <emphasis>not</emphasis> set.  It's a bad bug
that MSYS is affected by this, but if you have CYGWIN set to "ntsec ntea", which is right for Cygwin, it
causes the MSYS <command>ssh</command> to bogusly fail complaining that your <filename>.ssh/identity</filename>
file has too-liberal permissinos.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Here are some points to bear in mind when using MSYS:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <para> MSYS does some kind of special magic to binaries stored in 
<filename>/bin</filename> and <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, which are by default both mapped
to <filename>c:/msys/1.0/bin</filename> (assuming you installed MSYS in <filename>c:/msys</filename>).
Do not put any other binaries (such as GHC or Alex) in this directory or its sub-directories: 
they fail in mysterious ways.  However, it's fine to put other binaries in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>,
which maps to <filename>c:/msys/1.0/local/bin</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para> MSYS seems to implement symbolic links by copying, so sharing is lost.
</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para>
Win32 has a <command>find</command> command which is not the same as MSYS's find.
You will probably discover that the Win32 <command>find</command> appears in your <constant>PATH</constant>
before the MSYS one, because it's in the <emphasis>system</emphasis> <constant>PATH</constant> 
environment variable, whereas you have probably modified the <emphasis>user</emphasis> <constant>PATH</constant> 
variable.  You can always invoke <command>find</command> with an absolute path, or rename it.
</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para>
MSYS comes with <command>bzip</command>, and MSYS's <command>tar</command>'s <literal>-j</literal> 
will bunzip an archive (e.g. <literal>tar xvjf foo.tar.bz2</literal>).  Useful when you get a
bzip'd dump.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Installing and configuring Cygwin</title>

<para> Install Cygwin from <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</ulink>.
The installation process is straightforward; we install it in <filename>c:/cygwin</filename>.
During the installation dialogue, make sure that you select all of the following:
	      <command>cvs</command>, 
	      <command>openssh</command>,
	      <command>autoconf</command>,
	      <command>binutils</command> (includes ld and (I think) ar),
	      <command>gcc</command>,
	      <command>flex</command>,
	      <command>make</command>.
If you miss out any of these, strange things will happen to you.   To see thse packages, 
click on the "View" button in the "Select Packages" 
stage of Cygwin's installation dialogue, until the view says "Full".  The default view, which is
"Category" isn't very helpful, and the "View" button is rather unobtrousive.
</para>
<para> Now set the following user environment variables:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Add <filename>c:/cygwin/bin</filename> and <filename>c:/cygwin/usr/bin</filename> to your 
<constant>PATH</constant></para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Set <constant>MAKE_MODE</constant> to <literal>UNIX</literal>. If you
don't do this you get very weird messages when you type
<command>make</command>, such as:
<screen>/c: /c: No such file or directory</screen>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> Set <constant>SHELL</constant> to
<filename>c:/cygwin/bin/bash</filename>. When you invoke a shell in Emacs, this
<constant>SHELL</constant> is what you get.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Set <constant>HOME</constant> to point to your 
home directory.  This is where, for example,
<command>bash</command> will look for your <filename>.bashrc</filename>
file.  Ditto <command>emacs</command> looking for <filename>.emacsrc</filename>
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
There are a few other things to do:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
By default, cygwin provides the command shell <filename>ash</filename>
as <filename>sh.exe</filename>. We have often seen build-system problems that 
turn out to be due to bugs in <filename>ash</filename>
(to do with quoting
and length of command lines).  On the other hand <filename>bash</filename> seems
to be rock solid.
So, in <filename>cygwin/bin</filename>
remove the supplied <filename>sh.exe</filename> (or rename it as <filename>ash.exe</filename>),
and copy <filename>bash.exe</filename> to  <filename>sh.exe</filename>.
You'll need to do this in Windows Explorer or the Windows <command>cmd</command> shell, because
you can't rename a running program!
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Some script files used in the make system start with "<command>#!/bin/perl</command>",
(and similarly for <command>sh</command>).  Notice the hardwired path!
So you need to ensure that your <filename>/bin</filename> directory has the following
binaries in it:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <para><command>sh</command></para></listitem>
<listitem> <para><command>perl</command></para></listitem>
<listitem> <para><command>cat</command></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
All these come in Cygwin's <filename>bin</filename> directory, which you probably have
installed as <filename>c:/cygwin/bin</filename>.  By default Cygwin mounts "<filename>/</filename>" as
<filename>c:/cygwin</filename>, so if you just take the defaults it'll all work ok.
(You can discover where your Cygwin
root directory <filename>/</filename> is by typing <command>mount</command>.)
Provided <filename>/bin</filename> points to the Cygwin <filename>bin</filename>
directory, there's no need to copy anything.  If not, copy these binaries from the <filename>cygwin/bin</filename>
directory (after fixing the <filename>sh.exe</filename> stuff mentioned in the previous bullet).
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Finally, here are some things to be aware of when using Cygwin:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <para>Cygwin doesn't deal well with filenames that include
spaces. "<filename>Program Files</filename>" and "<filename>Local files</filename>" are
common gotchas.
</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para> Cygwin implements a symbolic link as a text file with some
magical text in it.  So other programs that don't use Cygwin's
I/O libraries won't recognise such files as symlinks.  
In particular, programs compiled by GHC are meant to be runnable
without having Cygwin, so they don't use the Cygwin library, so
they don't recognise symlinks.
</para></listitem>

<listitem> <para>
See the notes in <xref linkend="msys-install"/> about <command>find</command> and <command>bzip</command>,
which apply to Cygwin too.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2 id="configure-ssh"><title>Configuring SSH</title>

<para><command>ssh</command> comes with Cygwin, provided you remember to ask for it when
you install Cygwin.  (If not, the installer lets you update easily.)  Look for <command>openssh</command> 
(not ssh) in the Cygwin list of applications!</para>

<para>There are several strange things about <command>ssh</command> on Windows that you need to know.
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
       The programs <command>ssh-keygen1</command>, <command>ssh1</command>, and <command>cvs</command>,
       seem to lock up <command>bash</command> entirely if they try to get user input (e.g. if
       they ask for a password).  To solve this, start up <filename>cmd.exe</filename> 
       and run it as follows:
<screen>c:\tmp> set CYGWIN32=tty
c:\tmp> c:/user/local/bin/ssh-keygen1</screen> </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> (Cygwin-only problem, I think.)
<command>ssh</command> needs to access your directory <filename>.ssh</filename>, in your home directory.  
To determine your home directory <command>ssh</command> first looks in 
<filename>c:/cygwin/etc/passwd</filename> (or wherever you have Cygwin installed).  If there's an entry
there with your userid, it'll use that entry to determine your home directory, <emphasis>ignoring
the setting of the environment variable $HOME</emphasis>.  If the home directory is
bogus, <command>ssh</command> fails horribly.   The best way to see what is going on is to say
<screen>ssh -v cvs.haskell.org</screen>
which makes <command>ssh</command> print out information about its activity.
</para>
<para> You can fix this problem, either by correcting the home-directory field in 
<filename>c:/cygwin/etc/passwd</filename>, or by simply deleting the entire entry for your userid. If
you do that, <command>ssh</command> uses the $HOME environment variable instead.
</para>

<sect2><title>Other things you need to install</title>

<para>You have to install the following other things to build GHC, listed below.</para>

<para>On Windows you often install executables in directories with spaces, such as 
"<filename>Program Files</filename>". However, the <literal>make</literal> system for fptools doesn't 
deal with this situation (it'd have to do more quoting of binaries), so you are strongly advised
to put binaries for all tools in places with no spaces in their path.
On both MSYS and Cygwin, it's perfectly OK to install such programs in the standard Unixy places,
<filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> and <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>.  But it doesn't matter,
provided they are in your path.

Install an executable Happy, from <ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/happy">http://www.haskell.org/happy</ulink>.
Happy is a parser generator used to compile the Haskell grammar.  Under MSYS or Cygwin you can easily
build it from the source distribution using
<screen>$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install</screen>
This should install it in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> (which maps to <filename>c:/msys/1.0/local/bin</filename>
on MSYS).
Make sure the installation directory is in your

in your path.
</para>

<para><emphasis>On Cygwin, do not</emphasis> add any of the <emphasis>mingw</emphasis> binaries to your  path.
They are only going to get used by explicit access (via the --with-gcc flag you

The most convenient way to do this is by going <literal>make boot</literal> in <filename>fptools/ghc</filename>.

Furthermore, it's <emphasis>very important</emphasis> that you specify a

<filename>/cygdrive/c/mingw/bin/gcc</filename>, and GHC will fail the first
time it tries to invoke it.   Worse, the failure comes with
no error message whatsoever.  GHC simply fails silently when first invoked, 
typically leaving you with this:
<screen>make[4]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/e/fptools-stage1/ghc/rts/gmp'

you'll have to do something more like:
<screen>$ ./configure --with-gcc=...the Cygwin gcc...</screen>

If you are paranoid, delete <filename>config.cache</filename> if it exists.
This file occasionally remembers out-of-date configuration information, which 
can be really confusing.

<listitem><para> You almost certainly want to set
<programlisting>SplitObjs = NO</programlisting>
in your <filename>build.mk</filename> configuration file (see <xref linkend="sec-build-config"/>).
This tells the build system not to split each library into a myriad of little object files, one
for each function.  Doing so reduces binary sizes for statically-linked binaries, but on Windows
it dramatically increases the time taken to build the libraries in the first place.
