	<listitem>
	  <para>Within reason, more memory for heap space means less

          you'll get a garbage-collector report.  (Again, you can use

	  <para>If it says you're using more than 20&percnt; of total

          option.  Increasing the default allocation area size used by

    <title>Faster: producing a program that runs quicker</title>

    <indexterm><primary>faster programs, how to produce</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The key tool to use in making your Haskell program run
    faster are GHC's profiling facilities, described separately in
    <xref linkend="profiling"/>.  There is <emphasis>no
    substitute</emphasis> for finding where your program's time/space
    is <emphasis>really</emphasis> going, as opposed to where you
    imagine it is going.</para>

    <para>Another point to bear in mind: By far the best way to
    improve a program's performance <emphasis>dramatically</emphasis>
    is to use better algorithms.  Once profiling has thrown the
    spotlight on the guilty time-consumer(s), it may be better to
    re-think your program than to try all the tweaks listed below.</para>

    <para>Another extremely efficient way to make your program snappy
    is to use library code that has been Seriously Tuned By Someone
    Else.  You <emphasis>might</emphasis> be able to write a better
    quicksort than the one in <literal>Data.List</literal>, but it
    will take you much longer than typing <literal>import
    Data.List</literal>.</para>

    <para>Please report any overly-slow GHC-compiled programs.  Since
    GHC doesn't have any credible competition in the performance
    department these days it's hard to say what overly-slow means, so
    just use your judgement!  Of course, if a GHC compiled program
    runs slower than the same program compiled with NHC or Hugs, then
    it's definitely a bug.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the most basic way to make your program go

	<term>Compile via LLVM:</term>
	<listitem>
		<para>The <link linkend="llvm-code-gen">LLVM code generator</link> can
			sometimes do a far better job at producing fast code than the <link
				linkend="native-code-gen">native code generator</link>. This is not
			universal and depends on the code. Numeric heavy code seems to show
			the best improvement when compiled via LLVM. You can also experiment
			with passing specific flags to LLVM with the <option>-optlo</option>
			and <option>-optlc</option> flags.  Be careful though as setting these
			flags stops GHC from setting its usual flags for the LLVM optimiser

	<term>Overloaded functions are not your friend:</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Haskell's overloading (using type classes) is elegant,
          neat, etc., etc., but it is death to performance if left to
          linger in an inner loop.  How can you squash it?</para>

	  <variablelist>
	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>Give explicit type signatures:</term>
	      <listitem>
		<para>Signatures are the basic trick; putting them on
                exported, top-level functions is good
                software-engineering practice, anyway.  (Tip: using
                <option>-fwarn-missing-signatures</option><indexterm><primary>-fwarn-missing-signatures
                option</primary></indexterm> can help enforce good

		<para>The automatic specialisation of overloaded

		<para>A low-tech way: grep (search) your interface
                files for overloaded type signatures.  You can view
                interface files using the

	<term>Strict functions are your dear friends:</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>and, among other things, lazy pattern-matching is your
	  enemy.</para>

	  <para>(If you don't know what a &ldquo;strict
          function&rdquo; is, please consult a functional-programming
          textbook.  A sentence or two of explanation here probably
          would not do much good.)</para>

	  <para>Consider these two code fragments:

<programlisting>
f (Wibble x y) =  ... # strict

f arg = let { (Wibble x y) = arg } in ... # lazy
</programlisting>

           The former will result in far better code.</para>

	  <para>A less contrived example shows the use of
          <literal>cases</literal> instead of <literal>lets</literal>
          to get stricter code (a good thing):

<programlisting>
f (Wibble x y)  # beautiful but slow
  = let
        (a1, b1, c1) = unpackFoo x
        (a2, b2, c2) = unpackFoo y

	  <para>It's all the better if a function is strict in a

          single field, use a <literal>newtype</literal> declaration
          instead of a <literal>data</literal> declaration.  The
          <literal>newtype</literal> will be optimised away in most
          cases.</para>

	<term>&ldquo;How do I find out a function's strictness?&rdquo;</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Don't guess&mdash;look it up.</para>

	  <para>Look for your function in the interface file, then for
          the third field in the pragma; it should say
          <literal>Strictness: &lt;string&gt;</literal>.  The
          <literal>&lt;string&gt;</literal> gives the strictness of
          the function's arguments: see <ulink url="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/Demand">
          the GHC Commentary</ulink> for a description of the strictness notation.
          </para>

	  <para>For an &ldquo;unpackable&rdquo;
          <function>U(...)</function> argument, the info inside tells
          the strictness of its components.  So, if the argument is a
          pair, and it says <function>U(AU(LSS))</function>, that
          means &ldquo;the first component of the pair isn't used; the
          second component is itself unpackable, with three components
          (lazy in the first, strict in the second \&#38;
          third).&rdquo;</para>

	  <para>If the function isn't exported, just compile with the
          extra flag <option>-ddump-simpl</option>; next to the
          signature for any binder, it will print the self-same
          pragmatic information as would be put in an interface file.

	<term>Explicit <literal>export</literal> list:</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If you do not have an explicit export list in a
          module, GHC must assume that everything in that module will
          be exported.  This has various pessimising effects.  For
          example, if a bit of code is actually
          <emphasis>unused</emphasis> (perhaps because of unfolding
          effects), GHC will not be able to throw it away, because it
          is exported and some other module may be relying on its
          existence.</para>

	  <para>GHC can be quite a bit more aggressive with pieces of
          code if it knows they are not exported.</para>

          (don't forget the <option>-O</option>).</para>

	  <para>If profiling has pointed the finger at particular
          functions, look at their Core code.  <literal>lets</literal>
          are bad, <literal>cases</literal> are good, dictionaries
          (<literal>d.&lt;Class&gt;.&lt;Unique&gt;</literal>) &lsqb;or

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Use strictness annotations:</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Putting a strictness annotation ('!') on a constructor
	  field helps in two ways: it adds strictness to the program,
	  which gives the strictness analyser more to work with, and
	  it might help to reduce space leaks.</para>

	  <para>It can also help in a third way: when used with
	  <option>-funbox-strict-fields</option> (see <xref
	  linkend="options-f"/>), a strict field can be unpacked or
	  unboxed in the constructor, and one or more levels of
	  indirection may be removed.  Unpacking only happens for
	  single-constructor datatypes (<literal>Int</literal> is a
	  good candidate, for example).</para>

	  <para>Using <option>-funbox-strict-fields</option> is only
	  really a good idea in conjunction with <option>-O</option>,
	  because otherwise the extra packing and unpacking won't be
	  optimised away.  In fact, it is possible that
	  <option>-funbox-strict-fields</option> may worsen
	  performance even <emphasis>with</emphasis>
	  <option>-O</option>, but this is unlikely (let us know if it

	  <para><literal>Floats</literal> (probably 32-bits) are
