        This section lists Glasgow Haskell infelicities in its
        implementation of Haskell&nbsp;98 and Haskell&nbsp;2010.
        See also the &ldquo;when things go wrong&rdquo; section
        (<xref linkend="wrong"/>) for information about crashes,
        space leaks, and other undesirable phenomena.

    <title>Divergence from Haskell&nbsp;98 and Haskell&nbsp;2010</title>

    <para>
        By default, GHC mainly aims to behave (mostly) like a Haskell&nbsp;2010
        compiler, although you can tell it to try to behave like a
        particular version of the language with the
        <literal>-XHaskell98</literal> and
        <literal>-XHaskell2010</literal> flags. The known deviations
        from the standards are described below. Unless otherwise stated,
        the deviation applies in Haskell&nbsp;98, Haskell&nbsp;2010 and
        the default modes.
    </para>

      <title>Lexical syntax</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Certain lexical rules regarding qualified identifiers
	  are slightly different in GHC compared to the Haskell
	  report.  When you have
	  <replaceable>module</replaceable><literal>.</literal><replaceable>reservedop</replaceable>,
	  such as <literal>M.\</literal>, GHC will interpret it as a
	  single qualified operator rather than the two lexemes
	  <literal>M</literal> and <literal>.\</literal>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect3>

      <sect3 id="infelicities-syntax">
	<title>Context-free syntax</title>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>In Haskell&nbsp;98 mode and by default (but not in
          Haskell&nbsp;2010 mode), GHC is a little less strict about the
          layout rule when used
	      in <literal>do</literal> expressions.  Specifically, the
	      restriction that "a nested context must be indented further to
	      the right than the enclosing context" is relaxed to allow the
	      nested context to be at the same level as the enclosing context,
	      if the enclosing context is a <literal>do</literal>
	      expression.</para>

	    <para>For example, the following code is accepted by GHC:

<programlisting>
main = do args &lt;- getArgs
	  if null args then return [] else do
          ps &lt;- mapM process args
          mapM print ps</programlisting>

        This behaviour is controlled by the
        <literal>NondecreasingIndentation</literal> extension.
	      </para>
	  </listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GHC doesn't do the fixity resolution in expressions during
	  parsing as required by Haskell&nbsp;98 (but not by Haskell&nbsp;2010).
      For example, according to the Haskell&nbsp;98 report, the
	  following expression is legal:
<programlisting>
    let x = 42 in x == 42 == True</programlisting>
	and parses as:
<programlisting>
    (let x = 42 in x == 42) == True</programlisting>

          because according to the report, the <literal>let</literal>
	  expression <quote>extends as far to the right as
	  possible</quote>.  Since it can't extend past the second
	  equals sign without causing a parse error
	  (<literal>==</literal> is non-fix), the
	  <literal>let</literal>-expression must terminate there.  GHC
	  simply gobbles up the whole expression, parsing like this:
<programlisting>
    (let x = 42 in x == 42 == True)</programlisting></para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect3>

  <sect3 id="infelicities-exprs-pats">
      <title>Expressions and patterns</title>

    <para>In its default mode, GHC makes some programs slightly more defined 
    than they should be. For example, consider
    <programlisting>
f :: [a] -> b -> b
f [] = error "urk"
f (x:xs) = \v -> v

main = print (f [] `seq` True)
    </programlisting>
This should call <literal>error</literal> but actually prints <literal>True</literal>.
Reason: GHC eta-expands <literal>f</literal> to
    <programlisting>
f :: [a] -> b -> b
f []     v = error "urk"
f (x:xs) v = v
    </programlisting>
This improves efficiency slightly but significantly for most programs, and
is bad for only a few.  To suppress this bogus "optimisation" use <option>-fpedantic-bottoms</option>.
</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="infelicities-decls">
      <title>Declarations and bindings</title>

      <para>In its default mode, GHC does not accept datatype contexts,
      as it has been decided to remove them from the next version of the
      language standard. This behaviour can be controlled with the
      <option>DatatypeContexts</option> extension.
      See <xref linkend="datatype-contexts" />.</para>
    </sect3>

      <sect3 id="infelicities-Modules">
	<title>Module system and interface files</title>

	<para>GHC requires the use of <literal>hs-boot</literal>
	  files to cut the recursive loops among mutually recursive modules
	  as described in <xref linkend="mutual-recursion"/>.  This more of an infelicity
	    than a bug: the Haskell Report says
	  (<ulink url="http://haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html#sect5.7">Section 5.7</ulink>) "Depending on the Haskell
	implementation used, separate compilation of mutually
	recursive modules may require that imported modules contain
	additional information so that they may be referenced before
	they are compiled. Explicit type signatures for all exported
	values may be necessary to deal with mutual recursion. The
	precise details of separate compilation are not defined by
	this Report."

	    </indexterm> function (and hence

	    </indexterm>) is a special case when
	  converting to <literal>Int</literal>.  The value of
	  <literal>fromIntegral x :: Int</literal> is given by taking
	  the lower <replaceable>n</replaceable> bits of <literal>(abs
	  x)</literal>, multiplied by the sign of <literal>x</literal>
	  (in 2's complement <replaceable>n</replaceable>-bit
	  arithmetic).  This behaviour was chosen so that for example
	  writing <literal>0xffffffff :: Int</literal> preserves the

	   <para>Negative literals, such as <literal>-3</literal>, are
             specified by (a careful reading of) the Haskell Report as

	     So <literal>-2147483648</literal> means <literal>negate (fromInteger 2147483648)</literal>.
	     Since <literal>fromInteger</literal> takes the lower 32 bits of the representation,
	     <literal>fromInteger (2147483648::Integer)</literal>, computed at type <literal>Int</literal> is
	     <literal>-2147483648::Int</literal>.  The <literal>negate</literal> operation then
	     overflows, but it is unchecked, so <literal>negate (-2147483648::Int)</literal> is just
	     <literal>-2147483648</literal>.  In short, one can write <literal>minBound::Int</literal> as

	<para>GHC does not allow you to have a data type with a context

	  so that <literal>MkT</literal>'s type is
<programlisting>
  MkT :: forall a b. C a b => a -> T a

        In principle, with a suitable class declaration with a functional dependency,
	 it's possible that this type is not ambiguous; but GHC nevertheless rejects
	  it.  The type variables mentioned in the context of the data type declaration must

        <para>We have never found another class of programs, other

        intended 32-bit or 64-bit precision.  Floating-point results
        may differ when optimisation is turned on.  In the worst case,
        referential transparency is violated, because for example
        <literal>let x = E1 in E2</literal> can evaluate to a
        different value than <literal>E2[E1/x]</literal>.</para>

          One workaround is to use the
          <option>-msse2</option><indexterm><primary><option>-msse2</option></primary></indexterm>
          option (see <xref linkend="options-platform" />, which
          generates code to use the SSE2 instruction set instead of
          the x87 instruction set.  SSE2 code uses the correct
          precision for all floating-point operations, and so gives
          deterministic results.  However, note that this only works
          with processors that support SSE2 (Intel Pentium 4 or AMD
          Athlon 64 and later), which is why the option is not enabled
          by default.  The libraries that come with GHC are probably
          built without this option, unless you built GHC yourself.

	<para>GHCi does not respect the <literal>default</literal>
        declaration in the module whose scope you are in.  Instead,
        for expressions typed at the command line, you always get the
        default default-type behaviour; that is,

      <para>On Windows, there's a GNU ld/BFD bug
      whereby it emits bogus PE object files that have more than
      0xffff relocations. When GHCi tries to load a package affected by this
      bug, you get an error message of the form
<screen>
Loading package javavm ... linking ... WARNING: Overflown relocation field (# relocs found: 30765)
</screen>
      The last time we looked, this bug still
      wasn't fixed in the BFD codebase, and there wasn't any
      noticeable interest in fixing it when we reported the bug
      back in 2001 or so.

      <para>The workaround is to split up the .o files that make up
      your package into two or more .o's, along the lines of
      how the "base" package does it.</para>

          GHCi does not keep careful track of what instance
          declarations are 'in scope' if they come from other
          packages.  Instead, all instance declarations that GHC has
          seen in other packages are all available at the prompt,
          whether or not the instance really ought to be in visible
          given the current set of modules in scope.
