  <para>A package is a library of Haskell modules known to the compiler.  GHC
    comes with several packages: see the accompanying 
    <ulink url="../libraries/index.html">library documentation</ulink>.</para>

  <para>Using a package couldn't be simpler: if you're using
    <option>--make</option> or GHCi, then most of the installed packages will be
    automatically available to your program without any further options.  The
    exceptions to this rule are covered below in <xref
      linkend="using-packages" />.</para>

  <para>Building your own packages is also quite straightforward: we provide
    the <ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal</ulink> infrastructure which
    automates the process of configuring, building, installing and distributing
    a package.  All you need to do is write a simple configuration file, put a
    few files in the right places, and you have a package.  See the
    <ulink url="../Cabal/index.html">Cabal documentation</ulink>
    for details, and also the Cabal libraries (<ulink url="../libraries/Cabal/Distribution-Simple.html">Distribution.Simple</ulink>,
    for example).</para>

  <title>Using Packages
  </title>
    <indexterm><primary>packages</primary>
      <secondary>using</secondary></indexterm>
    
    <para>To see which packages are installed, use the
      <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> command:</para>

<screen>
$ ghc-pkg list
/usr/lib/ghc-6.4/package.conf:
    base-1.0, haskell98-1.0, template-haskell-1.0, mtl-1.0, unix-1.0,
    Cabal-1.0, haskell-src-1.0, parsec-1.0, network-1.0,
    QuickCheck-1.0, HUnit-1.1, fgl-1.0, X11-1.1, HGL-3.1, OpenGL-2.0,
    GLUT-2.0, stm-1.0, readline-1.0, (lang-1.0), (concurrent-1.0),
    (posix-1.0), (util-1.0), (data-1.0), (text-1.0), (net-1.0),
    (hssource-1.0), rts-1.0
      </screen>

    <para>Packages are either exposed or hidden.  Only
      modules from exposed packages may be imported by your Haskell code; if
      you try to import a module from a hidden package, GHC will emit an error
      message.</para>

    <para>Each package has an exposed flag, which says whether it is exposed by
      default or not.  Packages hidden by default are listed in
      parentheses (eg. <literal>(lang-1.0)</literal>) in the output from
      <literal>ghc-pkg list</literal>.  To expose a package which is hidden by
      default, use the <option>-package</option>
      flag (see below).</para>
    
    <para>To see which modules are exposed by a package:</para>
    
<screen>
$ ghc-pkg field network exposed-modules
exposed-modules: Network.BSD,
                 Network.CGI,
                 Network.Socket,
                 Network.URI,
                 Network
</screen>

    <para>In general, packages containing hierarchical modules are usually
      exposed by default.  However, it is possible for two packages to contain
      the same module: in this case, only one of the packages should be
      exposed.  It is an error to import a module that belongs to more than one
      exposed package.</para>

    <para>The GHC command line options that control packages are:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>
	  <option>-package <replaceable>P</replaceable></option>
	  <indexterm><primary><option>-package</option></primary></indexterm>
	</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>This option causes package <replaceable>P</replaceable> to be
	    exposed.  The package <replaceable>P</replaceable> can be specified
	    in full with its version number
	    (e.g. <literal>network-1.0</literal>) or the version number can be
	    omitted if there is only one version of the package
	    installed.</para>

	  <para>If there are multiple versions of <replaceable>P</replaceable>
	    installed, then all other versions will become hidden.</para>

	  <para>The <option>-package <replaceable>P</replaceable></option>
	    option also causes package <replaceable>P</replaceable> to be
	    linked into the resulting executable.  In
	    <option>&ndash;&ndash;make</option> mode and GHCi, the compiler 
	    normally determines which packages are required by the current
	    Haskell modules, and links only those.  In batch mode however, the
	    dependency information isn't available, and explicit
	    <option>-package</option> options must be given when linking.</para>

	  <para>For example, to link a program consisting of objects
	    <filename>Foo.o</filename> and <filename>Main.o</filename>, where
	    we made use of the <literal>network</literal> package, we need to
	    give GHC the <literal>-package</literal> flag thus:  

<screen>$ ghc -o myprog Foo.o Main.o -package network</screen>

	    The same flag is necessary even if we compiled the modules from
	    source, because GHC still reckons it's in batch mode: 

<screen>$ ghc -o myprog Foo.hs Main.hs -package network</screen>

	    In <literal>--make</literal> and <literal>--interactive</literal>
	    modes (<xref linkend="modes" />), however, GHC figures out the
	    packages required for linking without further assistance.</para>

	  <para>The one other time you might need to use
	    <option>-package</option> to force linking a package is when the
	    package does not contain any Haskell modules (it might contain a C
	    library only, for example).  In that case, GHC
	    will never discover a dependency on it, so it has to be mentioned
	    explicitly.</para>

	    this flag, then any packages you require (including

	    <option>-package</option> options.</para>

	  <para>This is a good way to insulate your program from
	    differences in the globally exposed packages, and being
	    explicit about package dependencies is a Good Thing.
	    Cabal always passes the
	    <option>-hide-all-packages</option> flag to GHC, for
	    exactly this reason.</para>

	  <para>Note that the package might still end up being linked into the

  <sect2 id="package-overlaps">
    <title>Consequences of packages</title>

    <para>It is possible that by using packages you might end up with
    a program that contains two modules with the same name: perhaps
    you used a package P that has a <emphasis>hidden</emphasis> module
    M, and there is also a module M in your program.  Or perhaps the
    dependencies of packages that you used contain some overlapping
    modules.  Perhaps the program even contains multiple versions of a
    certain package, due to dependencies from other packages.</para>

    <para>None of these scenarios gives rise to an error on its
    own<footnote><para>it used to in GHC 6.4, but not since
    6.6</para></footnote>, but they may have some interesting
    consequences.  For instance, if you have a type
    <literal>M.T</literal> from version 1 of package
    <literal>P</literal>, then this is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the
    same as the type <literal>M.T</literal> from version 2 of package
    <literal>P</literal>, and GHC will report an error if you try to
    use one where the other is expected.</para>

    <para>Formally speaking, in Haskell 98, an entity (function, type
    or class) in a program is uniquely identified by the pair of the
    module name in which it is defined and its name.  In GHC, an
    entity is uniquely defined by a triple: package, module, and
    name.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="package-databases">
    <title>Package Databases</title>
      
    <para>A package database is a file, normally called
      <literal>package.conf</literal> which contains descriptions of installed
      packages.  GHC usually knows about two package databases:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The global package database, which comes with your GHC
	  installation.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>A package database private to each user.  On Unix
	  systems this will be
	  <filename>$HOME/.ghc/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>-<replaceable>os</replaceable>-<replaceable>version</replaceable>/package.conf</filename>, and on
	  Windows it will be something like
	  <filename>C:\Documents&nbsp;And&nbsp;Settings\<replaceable>user</replaceable>\ghc</filename>.
	  The <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> tool knows where this file should be
	  located, and will create it if it doesn't exist (see <xref linkend="package-management" />).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When GHC starts up, it reads the contents of these two package
      databases, and builds up a list of the packages it knows about.  You can
      see GHC's package table by running GHC with the <option>-v</option>
      flag.</para> 

    <para>Package databases may overlap: for example, packages in the user
      database will override those of the same name in the global
      database.</para> 

    <para>You can control the loading of package databses using the following
      GHC options:</para> 

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>

	  <para>Read in the package configuration file
	    <replaceable>file</replaceable> in addition to the system
	    default file and the user's local file.  Packages in additional
	    files read this way will override those in the global and user
	    databases.</para>

    <para>To create a new package database, just create
      a new file and put the string
      <quote><literal>[]</literal></quote> in it.  Packages can be
      added to the file using the
      <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> tool, described in <xref

      <para>The <literal>GHC_PACKAGE_PATH</literal> environment variable may be

      <para>If <literal>GHC_PACKAGE_PATH</literal> ends in a separator, then

    <para>We don't recommend building packages the hard way.  Instead, use the

      if possible.  If your package is particularly complicated or requires a

      <listitem>
	<para>You need to build an "installed package info" file for

      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
	<para>The Haskell code in a package may be built into one or
	  more archive libraries
	  (e.g. <filename>libHSfoo.a</filename>), or a single DLL on
	  Windows (e.g. <filename>HSfoo.dll</filename>).  The
	  restriction to a single DLL on Windows is because the
	  package system is used to tell the compiler when it should
	  make an inter-DLL call rather than an intra-DLL call
	  (inter-DLL calls require an extra
	  indirection). <emphasis>Building packages as DLLs doesn't
	  work at the moment; see <xref linkend="win32-dlls-create"/>
	  for the gory details.</emphasis>
	  </para>

	<para>Building a static library is done by using the
	  <literal>ar</literal> tool, like so:</para>

<screen>ar cqs libHSfoo.a A.o B.o C.o ...</screen>

	<para>where <filename>A.o</filename>,
	  <filename>B.o</filename> and so on are the compiled Haskell

	  system, so check the documentation if you run into
	  difficulties.</para>

	<para>Versions of the Haskell libraries for use with GHCi
	  may also be included: GHCi cannot load <literal>.a</literal>
	  files directly, instead it will look for an object file
	  called <filename>HSfoo.o</filename> and load that.  On some
	  systems, the <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> tool can
	  automatically build the GHCi version of each library, see
	  <xref linkend="package-management"/>.  To build these

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
      <para>To compile a module which is to be part of a new package,

            <para>Note: the argument to <option>-package-name</option>
            should be the full package identifier for the package,

    <para>It is worth noting that on Windows, when each package

    <para>The <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> tool allows packages to be
      added or removed from a package database.  By default,
      the system-wide package database is modified, but alternatively
      the user's local package database or another specified
      file can be used.</para>

    <para>To see what package databases are in use, say
      <literal>ghc-pkg&nbsp;list</literal>.  The stack of databases that
      <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> knows about can be modified using the

    <para>When asked to modify a database, <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> modifies
      the global database by default.  Specifying <option>--user</option>
      causes it to act on the user database, or <option>--package-conf</option>
      can be used to act on another database entirely.  When multiple of these

      considered to be the global database, and will be modified by default by
      <literal>ghc-pkg</literal>.  The intention here is that
      <literal>GHC_PACKAGE_PATH</literal> can be used to create a virtual

      Naming a package without the version number matches all versions of the

    <para>The full <ulink url="../Cabal/index.html">Cabal documentation</ulink>
      is still in preparation (at time of writing), so in the meantime
      here is a brief description of the syntax of this file:</para>

    <para>A package description consists of a number of field/value pairs.  A
      field starts with the field name in the left-hand column followed by a
      &ldquo;<literal>:</literal>&rdquo;, and the value continues until the next line that begins in the
      left-hand column, or the end of file.</para>

    <para>The syntax of the value depends on the field.   The various field
      types are:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>freeform</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Any arbitrary string, no interpretation or parsing is
	    done.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>string</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A sequence of non-space characters, or a sequence of arbitrary
	    characters surrounded by quotes <literal>"...."</literal>.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>string list</term>

	  <para>A sequence of strings, separated by commas.  The sequence may
	    be empty.</para>
	</listitem>

	    <para>(string list) A list of extra libraries for this package.  The
	    difference between <literal>hs-libraries</literal> and
	    <literal>extra-libraries</literal> is that
	    <literal>hs-libraries</literal> normally have several
	    versions, to support profiling, parallel and other build
	    options.  The various versions are given different
	    suffixes to distinguish them, for example the profiling
	    version of the standard prelude library is named
	    <filename>libHSbase_p.a</filename>, with the
	    <literal>_p</literal> indicating that this is a profiling
	    version.  The suffix is added automatically by GHC for
	    <literal>hs-libraries</literal> only, no suffix is added
	    for libraries in
	    <literal>extra-libraries</literal>.</para>

	    <para>The libraries listed in
	    <literal>extra-libraries</literal> may be any libraries
	    supported by your system's linker, including dynamic
	    libraries (<literal>.so</literal> on Unix,
	    <literal>.DLL</literal> on Windows).</para>

	    <para>Also, <literal>extra-libraries</literal> are placed
	    on the linker command line after the
	    <literal>hs-libraries</literal> for the same package.  If
	    your package has dependencies in the other direction (i.e.
	    <literal>extra-libraries</literal> depends on
	    <literal>hs-libraries</literal>), and the libraries are
	    static, you might need to make two separate

      The <literal>ghc-pkg</literal> tool performs expansion of
      environment variables occurring in input package specifications.
      So, if the <literal>mypkg</literal> was added to the package
      database as follows:
      </para>
<screen>
  $ installdir=/usr/local/lib ghc-pkg -a &lt; mypkg.pkg
</screen>

      <para>
      The occurrence of <literal>${installdir}</literal> is replaced
      with <literal>/usr/local/lib</literal> in the package data that
      is added for <literal>mypkg</literal>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
      This feature enables the distribution of package specification
      files that can be easily configured when installing.
      </para>

      <para>For examples of more package specifications, take a look
      at the <literal>package.conf</literal> in your GHC
      installation.</para>
