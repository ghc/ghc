Release notes for version 8.0.2
===============================

TODO FIXME

Highlights
----------

TODO FIXME.

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  :ghc-flag:`-XStaticPointers` now allows the body of the ``static`` form to
   refer to closed local bindings. For instance, this is now permitted:
   ``f = static x where x = 'a'``.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

-  The :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-constraints` flag has been removed from the
   :ghc-flag:`-Wall` flag set (see :ghc-ticket:`10635`).

-  The :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm` now dumps the result after C-- pipeline pass. Two
   more flags were added: :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm-from-stg` to allow to get the
   initial cmm from STG-to-C-- code generation and :ghc-flag:`-ddump-cmm-verbose`
   to obtain the intermediates from all C-- pipeline stages.

-  The RTS :ghc-flag: `-xb` now reads the base heap address in any base,
   defaulting to decimal, hexadecimal if the address starts with `0x`, and
   octal if the address starts with `0`.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Runtime linker on Windows is once again recognizing POSIX functions under their
  "deprecated" name. e.g. "strdup" will now be recognizes and internally forwarded to "_strdup".
  If you have existing code already using the correct names (e.g. _strdup) then this will just continue
  to work and no change is needed. For more information about how the forwarding is done please see
  `MSDN <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235384.aspx>`_ . This should now introduce the same behavior
  both compiled and interpreted. (see :ghc-ticket:`12497`).

-  Added :ghc-flag:`-fdefer-out-of-scope-variables`, which converts variable
   out of scope variables errors into warnings.

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- ``addModFinalizer`` now exposes the local typing environment at the splice
  point. This allows ``reify`` to see local and top-level definitions in the
  current declaration group when used as in

  .. code-block:: none

      f x = $(addModFinalizer (reify 'x >>= runIO . print) >> [| x |])

TODO FIXME Heading title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  GHCi now supports two new commands. :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+d`` performs
   defaulting on the type before reporting it to the user, and
   :ghci-cmd:`:type` ``+v`` refrains from instantiating any variables before
   reporting, which is useful in concert with :ghc-flag:`-XTypeApplications`.

   .. code-block:: none

	*X> :type +d length
	length :: [a] -> Int

	*X> :set -fprint-explicit-foralls
	*X> :type length
	length :: forall {a} {t :: * -> *}. Foldable t => t a -> Int
	*X> :type +v length
	length :: forall (t :: * -> *). Foldable t => forall a. t a -> Int

Libraries
---------

ghc
~~~

-  The ``GHC.initGhcMonad`` function no longer installs signal handlers by
   default. This means that the RTS won't attempt to handle Ctrl-C gracefully.
   If you would like to use GHC's signal handlers, call
   ``GHC.installSignalHandlers`` during initialization.
