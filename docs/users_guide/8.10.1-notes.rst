Release notes for version 8.10.1
===============================

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections.


Highlights

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Kind variables are no longer implicitly quantified when an explicit ``forall`` is used, see
  `GHC proposal #24
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0024-no-kind-vars.rst>`__.
  :ghc-flag:`-Wimplicit-kind-vars` is now obsolete.

- Kind variables are no longer implicitly quantified in constructor declarations: ::

    data T a        = T1 (S (a :: k) | forall (b::k). T2 (S b)  -- no longer accepted
    data T (a :: k) = T1 (S (a :: k) | forall (b::k). T2 (S b)  -- still accepted

- Implicitly quantified kind variables are no longer put in front of other variables: ::

    f :: Proxy (a :: k) -> Proxy (b :: j)

    ghci> :t +v f   -- old order:
    f :: forall k j (a :: k) (b :: j). Proxy a -> Proxy b

    ghci> :t +v f   -- new order:
    f :: forall k (a :: k) j (b :: j). Proxy a -> Proxy b

  This is a breaking change for users of :extension:`TypeApplications`.

- In type synonyms and type family equations, free variables on the RHS are no longer
  implicitly quantified unless used in an outermost kind annotation: ::

    type T = Just (Nothing :: Maybe a)         -- no longer accepted
    type T = Just Nothing :: Maybe (Maybe a)   -- still accepted

- GHC now parses visible, dependent quantifiers (as proposed in
  `GHC proposal 35
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0035-forall-arrow.rst>`__),
  such as the following: ::

    data Proxy :: forall k -> k -> Type

  See the `section on explicit kind quantification
  <#explicit-kind-quantification>`__ for more details.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Add new flags :ghc-flag:`-Wunused-record-wildcards` and
  :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-record-wildcards`  which warn users when they have
  redundant or unused uses of a record wildcard match.

- Calls to `memset` and `memcpy` are now unrolled more aggressively
  and the produced code is more efficient on `x86_64` with added
  support for 64-bit `MOV`s. In particular, `setByteArray#` and
  `copyByteArray#` calls that were not optimized before, now will
  be. See :ghc-ticket:`16052`.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``Lift`` typeclass is now levity-polymorphic and has a ``liftTyped``
  method. Previously disallowed instances for unboxed tuples, unboxed sums, an
  primitive unboxed types have also been added. Finally, the code generated by
  :ghc-flags:`-XDeriveLift` has been simplified to take advantage of expression
  quotations.

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add new `bitReverse#` primops that, for a `Word` of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits,
  reverse the order of its bits e.g. `0b110001` becomes `0b100011`.
  These primitives use optimized machine instructions when available.
