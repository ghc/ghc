===============================

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Kind variables are no longer implicitly quantified when an explicit ``forall`` is used, see
  `GHC proposal #24
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0024-no-kind-vars.rst>`__.
  :ghc-flag:`-Wimplicit-kind-vars` is now obsolete.

- Kind variables are no longer implicitly quantified in constructor declarations: ::

    data T a        = T1 (S (a :: k) | forall (b::k). T2 (S b)  -- no longer accepted
    data T (a :: k) = T1 (S (a :: k) | forall (b::k). T2 (S b)  -- still accepted

- Implicitly quantified kind variables are no longer put in front of other variables: ::

    f :: Proxy (a :: k) -> Proxy (b :: j)

    ghci> :t +v f   -- old order:
    f :: forall k j (a :: k) (b :: j). Proxy a -> Proxy b

    ghci> :t +v f   -- new order:
    f :: forall k (a :: k) j (b :: j). Proxy a -> Proxy b

  This is a breaking change for users of :extension:`TypeApplications`.

- In type synonyms and type family equations, free variables on the RHS are no longer
  implicitly quantified unless used in an outermost kind annotation: ::

    type T = Just (Nothing :: Maybe a)         -- no longer accepted
    type T = Just Nothing :: Maybe (Maybe a)   -- still accepted

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Add new flags :ghc-flag:`-Wunused-record-wildcards` and
  :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-record-wildcards`  which warn users when they have
  redundant or unused uses of a record wildcard match.
