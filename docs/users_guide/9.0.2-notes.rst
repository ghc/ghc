Version 9.0.2
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections.

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM versions 9

  different typechecker environment would be made available as an argument as
  compared to the monadic environment (see :ghc-ticket:`19191`).

  (:ghc-ticket:`19849`).

  interface files to be more portable (:ghc-ticket:`16956`).

- Fix some timer races in the RTS possibly manifesting in :ghc-ticket:`18033` and
  :ghc-ticket:`20132`.

  lazy bytestrings. (:ghc-ticket:`20107`).

- Fix some memory ordering issues manifesting on aarch64-darwin due to an RTS
  bug (:ghc-ticket:`20093`).

- Fix a bug leading to typechecker errors being discarded inside splices
  (:ghc-ticket:`20179`, :ghc-ticket:`19470`).

- Fix some spurious warnings arising from the interaction between
  ``-Wunused-packages`` and reexported modules (:ghc-ticket:`19518`,
  :ghc-ticket:`19777`, :ghc-ticket:`20242`).

- Fix an RTS bug causing ``allocateExec`` to fail with certain versions of
  ``libffi`` (:ghc-ticket:`20051`).

- Fix an RTS bug resulting a crash ``m32_allocator_init: Failed to map``
  (:ghc-ticket:`19421`).

- Stop leaking defunct llc processes (:ghc-ticket:`20305`).

- Fix an bug with the non moving GC leading to crashes due to missing write
  barriers (:ghc-ticket:`20399`, :ghc-ticket:`20414`).

  (:ghc-ticket:`20648`).

- Fix a bug with the GC resulting in object code being prematurely collected
  object code leading to runtime crashes (:ghc-ticket:`20649`).

  commit that removed the workaround for a bug (:ghc-ticket:`7651`) in the OSX
  implementation of kqueue. It turns out the bug still affects modern macOS
  versions, so we keep the workaround for now. (:ghc-ticket:`20662`).
