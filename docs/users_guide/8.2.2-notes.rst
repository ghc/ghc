Release notes for version 8.2.2
===============================

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed
in the following sections. This is a patch-level release which contains numerous
bug-fixes over 8.2.1.

Highlights
----------

The highlights since the 8.0 release include:

- Several important correctness issues fixing potential runtime crashes
  (:ghc-ticket:`13707`, :ghc-ticket:`14346`)

- A correctness issue leading to undefined behavior in some programs making use
  of STM (:ghc-ticket:`14171`)

- A runtime system bug which may have manifested as a segmentation fault under
  low-memory conditions (:ghc-ticket:`14329`)

- ``ghc-pkg`` now works correctly ihn environments with misconfigured NFS mounts
  (:ghc-ticket:`13945`)

- GHC can now produce position-independent executables (:ghc-ticket:`13702`)

- Significantly improved type errors (:ghc-ticket:`11198`, :ghc-ticket:`12373`,
  :ghc-ticket:`13530`, :ghc-ticket:`13610`)

Full details
------------

Package system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Various Backpack fixes (:ghc-ticket:`14304`)

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  Sum patterns are now considered to be non-irrefutable (:ghc-ticket:`14228`).

-  :ghc-flag:`-XApplicativeDo` is now able to more robustly deal with ``do``
   blocks containing strict patterns (:ghc-ticket:`14163`).

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- An implementation inconsistency leading to subtly typechecker panics with
   :ghc-flag:`-j ⟨n⟩` has been fixed.

- We now always link with ``libm``. This fixes ``ld.gold`` on some platforms
  (e.g. NixOS) which demand that we declare all link dependencies.

- We now link against ``libpthread`` instead of ``libthr`` on FreeBSD

- Fix renamer bug triggered by typechecking ``hs-boot`` files containing orphan
  instances (:ghc-ticket:`14128`)

- The cost-center profiler's event-log support now also supports breakdown by
  closure type (:rts-flag:`-hT`, :ghc-ticket:`14096`)

- A bug resulting in Core Lint failures for some programs using
  :ghc-flag:`-XStaticPointers` in GHCi has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`13481`)

- The compiler now robustly handles constraint wildcards which expand to large
  tuple constraints (i.e. wider than 63 constraints)

- We now catch more inappropriate levity polymorphism (:ghc-ticket:`13929`)

- A bug leading to data constructor fields having incorrect strictness
  signatures has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`14290`)

- An incorrect strictness signature for ``retry#`` which may result in undefined
  behavior at runtime has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`14171`)

- A bug in the short-cut solver leading to an infinite in typechecking has been
  fixed (:ghc-tickets:`13943`)

- The compiler no longer panics when faced with ``ByteArray#`` arguments in a
  ``foreign import``

- Over-zealous optimization of ``Foreign.Marshal.Alloc.allocBytes[Aligned]``
  resulting in undefined behavior has been worked around (:ghc-ticket:`14346`)

GHCi
~~~~

- GHCi now behaves correctly when :kbd:`Ctrl-C` is pressed on Windows (:ghc-ticket:`14150`)

- GHCi now takes a :ghc-flag:`-show-mods-loaded` flag to reenable showing of
  names of modules loaded by :ghci-cmd:`:load` (:ghc-ticket:`14427`)

Build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``configure`` now probes ``ld.gold`` even if ``ld.lld`` is found yet
   determined to be unusable (:ghc-ticket:`14280`)


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Compact regions now support small pointer arrays (:ghc-ticket:`13860`)

-  The RTS can now load DLLs with with an empty import table on 32-bit Windows (:ghc-ticket:`14081`)

-  The :rts-flag:`-po` flag now works; previously it existed but had no function.

-  Version number 0.68.2
