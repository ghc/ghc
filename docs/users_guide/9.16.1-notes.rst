.. _release-9-16-1:

Version 9.16.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.16>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Fix a bug introduced in GHC 9.10 where GHC would erroneously accept infix uses
  of promoted data constructors without enabling :extension:`DataKinds`. As a
  result, you may need to enable :extension:`DataKinds` in code that did not
  previously require it.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Code coverage's (:ghc-flag:`-fhpc`) treatment of record fields now extends
  beyond record fields accessed via :extension:`RecordWildCards` and
  :extension:`NamedFieldPuns`, and also handles access to nested record fields.
  That is, in a pattern such as ``Foo{bar = Bar{baz = b}}`` both ``bar`` and
  ``baz`` will now be marked as covered if ``b`` is evaluated. Note that this
  currently only works when record fields (or values contained within them) are
  bound to variables. The very similar pattern ``Foo{bar = Bar{baz = 42}}``
  will will not yet mark ``bar`` or ``baz`` as covered.

GHCi
~~~~

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a new `poll` I/O manager, based on the classic unix `poll()` API. It is
  available in the single-threaded RTS on posix platforms. The `select` I/O
  manager remains the default for this combination for now, but this default
  may change in future releases. The new I/O manager can be selected via the
  runtime flag :rts-flag:`--io-manager=(name)`.

  Compared to the `select` I/O manager, this one has slightly less severe
  restrictions on the number of sockets/pipes that can be waited on, though
  it still scales poorly for waiting on socket/pipe readiness. It does however
  scale much better for thread timers (such as `threadDelay`), and improves
  timer precision on 32bit Linux and 32bit FreeBSD from milliseconds to
  microseconds.

  This I/O manager introduces new infrastructure for I/O managers that is
  intended to be used in future for a new generation of in-RTS I/O managers,
  using more scalable platform-specific APIs (such as epoll, io_uring and
  kqueue). This first one, based on `poll()`, is merely intended to be
  portable.


Cmm
~~~

``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated to `Unicode 17.0.0
  <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0>`_.

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc-heap`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc-experimental`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``template-haskell`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We have added the ``addDependentDirectory`` function to match
  ``addDependentFile``, which adds a directory to the list of dependencies that
  the recompilation checker will look at to determine if a module needs to be
  recompiled.

Included libraries

The package database provided with this distribution also contains a number of
packages other than GHC itself. See the changelogs provided with these packages
for further change information.
