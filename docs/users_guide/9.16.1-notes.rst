Version 9.16.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.16>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Fix a bug introduced in GHC 9.10 where GHC would erroneously accept infix uses
  of promoted data constructors without enabling :extension:`DataKinds`. As a
  result, you may need to enable :extension:`DataKinds` in code that did not
  previously require it.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Code coverage's (:ghc-flag:`-fhpc`) treatment of record fields now extends
  beyond record fields accessed via :extension:`RecordWildCards` and
  :extension:`NamedFieldPuns`, and also handles access to nested record fields.
  That is, in a pattern such as ``Foo{bar = Bar{baz = b}}`` both ``bar`` and
  ``baz`` will now be marked as covered if ``b`` is evaluated. Note that this
  currently only works when record fields (or values contained within them) are
  bound to variables. The very similar pattern ``Foo{bar = Bar{baz = 42}}``
  will will not yet mark ``bar`` or ``baz`` as covered.
