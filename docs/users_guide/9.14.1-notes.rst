.. _release-9-14-1:

Version 9.14.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.14>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~

* ``-Wincomplete-record-selectors`` is now part of `-Wall`, as specified
  by `GHC Proposal 516: add warning for incomplete record selectors <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0516-incomplete-record-selectors.rst>_`.
  Hence, if a library is compiled with ``-Werror``, compilation may now fail. Solution: fix the library.
  Workaround: add ``-Werror=no-incomplete-record-selectors``.

  Note that this warning is at least
  as serious as a warning about missing patterns from a function definition, perhaps even
  more so, since it is invisible in the source program.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- An improved error message is introduced to refer users to the heap-controlling flags of the RTS when there is a heap overflow during compilation. (#25198)

GHCi
~~~~

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add new runtime flag :rts-flag:`--optimistic-linking` which instructs the
  runtime linker to continue in the presence of unknown symbols. By default this
  flag is not passed, preserving previous behavior.
