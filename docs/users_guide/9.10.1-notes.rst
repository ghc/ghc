.. _release-9-10-1:

Version 9.10.1
==============

Language
~~~~~~~~

- Part 1 of GHC Proposal `#281
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst>`_
  "Visible forall in types of terms" has been implemented.
  The following code is now accepted by GHC::

    idv :: forall a -> a -> a
    idv (type a) (x :: a) = x

    x = idv (type Int) 42

  This feature is guarded behind :extension:`RequiredTypeArguments` and :extension:`ExplicitNamespaces`.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- GHC Proposal `#516
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0516-incomplete-record-selectors.rst>`_
  has been implemented. It introduces a warning :ghc-flag:`-Wincomplete-record-selectors` which warns about when
  an invocation of a record selector may fail due to being applied to a constructor for which it is not defined.

  For example ::

    data T = T1 | T2 { x :: Int }
    f :: T -> Int
    f a = x a + 1 -- emit a warning here, since `f T1` will fail

  Unlike :ghc-flag:`-Wpartial-fields` this produces a warning about incomplete selectors at use sites instead of
  definition sites, so it is useful in cases when the library does intend for incomplete record selectors to be
  used but only in specific circumstances (e.g. when other cases are handled by previous pattern matches).

- The :ghc-flag:`-finfo-table-map-with-stack` and
  :ghc-flag:`-finfo-table-map-with-fallback` flags have been introduced. These
  flags include ``STACK`` info tables and info tables with default source
  location information in the info table map, respectively. They are implied by
  the :ghc-flag:`-finfo-table-map` flag. The corresponding negative flags
  (:ghc-flag:`-fno-info-table-map-with-stack`,
  :ghc-flag:`-fno-info-table-map-with-fallback`) are useful for omitting these
  info tables from the info table map and reducing the size of executables
  containing info table profiling information. In a test on the `Agda codebase
  <https://github.com/agda/agda>`_, the size of the build results was reduced by
  about 10% when these info tables were omitted.

- Fixed a bug where compiling with both :ghc-flag:`-ddump-timings` and :ghc-flag:`-ddump-to-file` did not
  suppress printing timings to the console. See :ghc-ticket:`20316`.

- Defaulting plugins can now propose solutions to entangled sets of type variables. This allows defaulting
  of multi-parameter type classes. See :ghc-ticket:`23832`.

- The :ghc-flag:`-fdistinct-constructor-tables
  <-fdistinct-constructor-tables=⟨cs⟩>` flag may now be provided with a list of
  constructor names for which distinct info tables should be generated. This
  avoids the default behavior of generating a distinct info table for *every*
  usage of *every* constructor, which often results in more information than is
  desired and significantly increases the size of executables.

- The :ghc-flag:`-fno-distinct-constructor-tables
  <-fno-distinct-constructor-tables=⟨cs⟩>` flag is introduced, which allows
  users to refine the set of constructors for which distinct info tables should
  be generated.

- The :ghc-flag:`-fdistinct-constructor-tables-per-module
  <-fdistinct-constructor-tables-per-module=⟨cs⟩>` flag is introduced. When
  provided, this flag will cause only one distinct info table to be created for
  every usage of a data constructor in a module, when
  :ghc-flag:`-fdistinct-constructor-tables <-fdistinct-constructor-tables=⟨cs⟩>`
  is enabled for that constructor.

  For example, consider a module containing five occurrences of some
  constructor. If that module is compiled with only
  :ghc-flag:`-fdistinct-constructor-tables <-fdistinct-constructor-tables=⟨cs⟩>`
  then five distinct info tables will be created, one for each occurrence of the
  constructor. If that module is also compiled with
  :ghc-flag:`-fdistinct-constructor-tables-per-module
  <-fdistinct-constructor-tables-per-module=⟨cs⟩>`, then only one info table
  will be created. This means that allocations resulting from any of those five
  occurrences will be attributed to that one info table when using the
  :rts-flag:`-hi` profiling mode.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Internal fragmentation incurred by the non-moving GC's allocator has been reduced for small objects.
  In one real-world application, this has reduced resident set size by about 20% and modestly improved run-time.
  See :ghc-ticket:`23340`.
  :rts-flag:`--nonmoving-dense-allocator-count=⟨count⟩` has been added to fine-tune this behaviour.

``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc-heap`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc-experimental`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduced per the `base library split proposal
  <https://github.com/Ericson2314/tech-proposals/blob/ghc-base-libraries/proposals/accepted/051-ghc-base-libraries.rst>`_

``template-haskell`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Extend ``Pat`` with ``TypeP`` and ``Exp`` with ``TypeE``,
  introduce functions ``typeP`` and ``typeE`` (Template Haskell support for GHC Proposal `#281
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst>`_).
