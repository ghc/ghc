                    There is a new extension,
                    <link linkend="static-pointers">StaticPointers</link>,
                    which allows you to create pointers to expressions which
                    remain valid across processes. This is useful for
                    referencing higher-order values in distributed
                    systems. The pointers are created with a new keyword
                    <literal>static</literal> as in
                    <literal>x = static ("abc" ++ "123") :: StaticPtr String</literal>.
                    All processes which dereference <literal>x</literal> get the
                    same result, that is, the body of the static form.

                    Simplified rules for implicit quantification. In previous versions of GHC,
                    it was possible to use the <literal>=></literal> arrow
                    to quantify over type variables in <literal>data</literal> and
                    <literal>type</literal> declarations without a
                    <literal>forall</literal> quantifier. For example,
                    <literal>data Fun = Fun (Ord a => a -> b)</literal> was identical to
                    <literal>data Fun = Fun (forall a b. Ord a => a -> b)</literal>, while
                    <literal>data Fun = Fun (a -> b)</literal> caused a not-in-scope error.
                    This implicit quantification is now deprecated, and variables
                    in higher-rank constructors should be quantified with <literal>forall</literal>
                    regardless of whether a class context is present or not.
                    GHC 7.10 raises a warning (controlled by
                    <option>-fwarn-context-quantification</option>, enabled by default)
                    and GHC 7.12 will raise an error. See <link linkend="univ">examples</link>
                    in GHC documentation.

                    The change also applies to Template Haskell splices such as
                    <literal>[t|Ord a => a|]</literal>, which should be written as
                    <literal>[t|forall a. Ord a => a|]</literal>.

               directives attached to <literal>data</literal> and <literal>newtype</literal>
               declarations now forbid equality constraints. This is a regression in
               obscure cases, but it will yield better error messages in more common
               cases. Users caught by the regression can simply use standalone-deriving,
               where you specify the context yourself.

                    GHC now checks that all the language extensions required for
                    the inferred type signatures are explicitly enabled. This
                    means that if any of the type signatures inferred in your
                    program requires some language extension you will need to
                    enable it. The motivation is that adding a missing type
                    signature inferred by GHC should yield a program that
                    typechecks. Previously this was not the case.

                    This is a breaking change. Code that used to compile in the
                    past might fail with an error message requiring some
                    particular language extension (most likely
                    <option>-XTypeFamilies</option>, <option>-XGADTs</option> or
                    <option>-XFlexibleContexts</option>).

                    <option>-fwarn-tabs</option> warning flag is turned on by
                    default with this release of GHC. It can be suppressed
                    either by using <literal>GHC_OPTIONS</literal> pragma or by
                    specifying <option>-fno-warn-tabs</option> flag.

                    The new <option>-fdefer-typed-holes</option> flag turns
                    typed hole errors into typed hole warnings that produce
                    runtime errors when evaluated.

                    The <option>-fno-warn-typed-holes</option> flag was
                    repurposed to silence the warnings produced when
                    <option>-fdefer-typed-holes</option> is used. As a result,
                    it is no longer possible to disable typed holes like it was
                    in GHC 7.8. This only turned a self-explanatory error into
                    a cryptic parse error and was thus not very useful.

                    <xref linkend="defer-type-errors"/>.

                    A new warning flag, <option>-fwarn-trustworthy-safe</option>
                    has been added and is turned on with
                    <option>-Wall</option>. It warns when a module that is
                    compiled with <option>-XTrustworthy</option> is actually
                    infered as an <option>-XSafe</option> module. This lets the
                    module author know that they can tighten their Safe Haskell
                    bounds if desired.

                    <option>-fwarn-unsafe</option> that warn if a module was
                    infered as Safe or Unsafe have been improved to work with
                    all Safe Haskell module types. Previously, they only worked
                    for unmarked modules where the compiler was infering the
                    modules Safe Haskell type. They now work even for modules
                    marked as <option>-XTrustworthy</option> or
                    <option>-XUnsafe</option>. This is useful either to have
                    GHC check your assumptions, or to generate a list of
                    reasons easily why a module is regarded as Unsafe.

                    For many use cases, the new
                    <option>-fwarn-trustworthy-safe</option> flag is better
                    suited than either of these two.

                    Many more options have learned to respect the <option>-ddump-to-file</option>.
                    For example you can use <option>-ddump-to-file</option> with <option>-ddump-splices</option>
                    to produce a <option>.dump-splices file</option>
                    for each file that uses Template Haskell.
                    This should be much easier to understand on a larger project
                    than having everything being dumped to stdout.

               solver, to add new functionality to GHC's

               A new warning flag, <option>-fwarn-missing-exported-sigs</option>
               has been added. The behavior is similar to
               <option>-fwarn-missing-signatures</option> but GHC will only
               flag exported values. This flag takes precedence over
               <option>-fwarn-missing-signatures</option> so it can be used
               in conjunction with <option>-Wall</option>.

               Added the option <option>-dth-dec-file</option>.

               This dumps out a .th.hs file of all Template Haskell
               declarations in a corresponding .hs file. The idea is
               that application developers can check this into their
               repository so that they can grep for identifiers used
               elsewhere that were defined in Template Haskell.  This
               is similar to using <option>-ddump-to-file</option>
               with <option>-ddump-splices</option> but it always
               generates a file instead of being coupled to
               <option>-ddump-to-file</option> and only outputs code
               that does not exist in the .hs file and a comment for
               the splice location in the original fi

                    ghc-pkg (and ghc) have dropped support for single-file style
                    package databases. Since version 6.12, ghc-pkg has defaulted
                    to a new database format (using a directory of files, one per
                    package plus a binary cache).

                    by directory removal, rather than simple file delete.

                    Many internal functions in GHC related to package IDs have been
                    renamed to refer to package keys, e.g. <literal>PackageId</literal>
                    is now <literal>PackageKey</literal>, the wired-in names
                    such as <literal>primPackageId</literal> are now
                    <literal>primPackageKey</literal>, etc.  This reflects a distinction
                    that we are now making: a package ID is, as before, the user-visible
                    ID from Cabal <literal>foo-1.0</literal>; a package key is now
                    a compiler-internal entity used for generating linking symbols, and
                    may not correspond at all to the package ID.  In
                    particular, there may be multiple package keys per
                    package ID.

                    The ghc library no longer depends on the Cabal library. This means
                    that users of the ghc library are no longer forced to use the same
                    version of Cabal as ghc did. It also means that Cabal is freed up
                    to be able to depend on packages that ghc does not want to depend
                    on (which for example may enable improvements to Cabal's parsing
                    infrastructure).
