Version 8.12.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections.


Highlights
----------

- TODO

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

Compiler
~~~~~~~~


GHCi
~~~~


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Implement the Overloaded Quotations proposal (#246). The type of all quotation
   forms have now been generalised in terms of a minimal interface necessary for the
   implementation rather than the overapproximation of the ``Q`` monad.

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - The type of the ``getAnnotations`` function has changed to better reflect
   the fact that it returns two different kinds of annotations, those on
   names and those on modules: ::

      getAnnotations :: Typeable a
                     => ([Word8] -> a) -> ModGuts
                     -> CoreM (ModuleEnv [a], NameEnv [a])


``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Included libraries
------------------

The package database provided with this distribution also contains a number of
packages other than GHC itself. See the changelogs provided with these packages
for further change information.
