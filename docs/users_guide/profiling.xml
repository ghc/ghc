  <para> Glasgow Haskell comes with a time and space profiling
  system. Its purpose is to help you improve your understanding of
  your program's execution behaviour, so you can improve it.</para>
  
  <para> Any comments, suggestions and/or improvements you have are
  welcome.  Recommended &ldquo;profiling tricks&rdquo; would be
  especially cool! </para>

  <para>Profiling a program is a three-step process:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para> Re-compile your program for profiling with the
      <literal>-prof</literal> option, and probably one of the
      <literal>-auto</literal> or <literal>-auto-all</literal>
      options.  These options are described in more detail in <xref
      linkend="prof-compiler-options"/> </para>
      <indexterm><primary><literal>-prof</literal></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><literal>-auto</literal></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><literal>-auto-all</literal></primary>
      </indexterm>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para> Run your program with one of the profiling options, eg.
      <literal>+RTS -p -RTS</literal>.  This generates a file of
      profiling information.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><option>-p</option></primary><secondary>RTS
      option</secondary></indexterm>
    </listitem>
      
    <listitem>
      <para> Examine the generated profiling information, using one of
      GHC's profiling tools.  The tool to use will depend on the kind
      of profiling information generated.</para>
    </listitem>
    
  </orderedlist>
  
  <sect1 id="cost-centres">
    <title>Cost centres and cost-centre stacks</title>
    
    <para>GHC's profiling system assigns <firstterm>costs</firstterm>
    to <firstterm>cost centres</firstterm>.  A cost is simply the time
    or space required to evaluate an expression.  Cost centres are
    program annotations around expressions; all costs incurred by the
    annotated expression are assigned to the enclosing cost centre.
    Furthermore, GHC will remember the stack of enclosing cost centres
    for any given expression at run-time and generate a call-graph of
    cost attributions.</para>

    <para>Let's take a look at an example:</para>

    <programlisting>
main = print (nfib 25)
nfib n = if n &lt; 2 then 1 else nfib (n-1) + nfib (n-2)
</programlisting>

    <para>Compile and run this program as follows:</para>

    <screen>
$ ghc -prof -auto-all -o Main Main.hs
$ ./Main +RTS -p
121393
$
</screen>

    <para>When a GHC-compiled program is run with the
    <option>-p</option> RTS option, it generates a file called
    <filename>&lt;prog&gt;.prof</filename>.  In this case, the file
    will contain something like this:</para>

</screen>


    <para>The first part of the file gives the program name and
    options, and the total time and total memory allocation measured
    during the run of the program (note that the total memory
    allocation figure isn't the same as the amount of
    <emphasis>live</emphasis> memory needed by the program at any one
    time; the latter can be determined using heap profiling, which we
    will describe shortly).</para>

    <para>The second part of the file is a break-down by cost centre
    of the most costly functions in the program.  In this case, there
    was only one significant function in the program, namely
    <function>nfib</function>, and it was responsible for 100&percnt;
    of both the time and allocation costs of the program.</para>

    <para>The third and final section of the file gives a profile
    break-down by cost-centre stack.  This is roughly a call-graph
    profile of the program.  In the example above, it is clear that
    the costly call to <function>nfib</function> came from
    <function>main</function>.</para>

    <para>The time and allocation incurred by a given part of the
    program is displayed in two ways: &ldquo;individual&rdquo;, which
    are the costs incurred by the code covered by this cost centre
    stack alone, and &ldquo;inherited&rdquo;, which includes the costs
    incurred by all the children of this node.</para>

    <para>The usefulness of cost-centre stacks is better demonstrated
    by  modifying the example slightly:</para>

    <programlisting>
main = print (f 25 + g 25)
f n  = nfib n
g n  = nfib (n `div` 2)
nfib n = if n &lt; 2 then 1 else nfib (n-1) + nfib (n-2)
</programlisting>

    <para>Compile and run this program as before, and take a look at
    the new profiling results:</para>

</screen>

    <para>Now although we had two calls to <function>nfib</function>
    in the program, it is immediately clear that it was the call from
    <function>f</function> which took all the time.</para>

    <para>The actual meaning of the various columns in the output is:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>

	  (excluding profiling overheads) of the program made by this
	  call and all of its sub-calls.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>In addition you can use the <option>-P</option> RTS option
    <indexterm><primary><option>-P</option></primary></indexterm> to
    get the following additional information:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>ticks</literal></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The raw number of time &ldquo;ticks&rdquo; which were
          attributed to this cost-centre; from this, we get the
          <literal>&percnt;time</literal> figure mentioned
          above.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>bytes</literal></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Number of bytes allocated in the heap while in this
          cost-centre; again, this is the raw number from which we get
          the <literal>&percnt;alloc</literal> figure mentioned
          above.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>What about recursive functions, and mutually recursive
    groups of functions?  Where are the costs attributed?  Well,
    although GHC does keep information about which groups of functions
    called each other recursively, this information isn't displayed in
    the basic time and allocation profile, instead the call-graph is
    flattened into a tree.  The XML profiling tool (described in <xref
    linkend="prof-xml-tool"/>) will be able to display real loops in
    the call-graph.</para>

    <sect2><title>Inserting cost centres by hand</title>

      <para>Cost centres are just program annotations.  When you say
      <option>-auto-all</option> to the compiler, it automatically
      inserts a cost centre annotation around every top-level function
      in your program, but you are entirely free to add the cost
      centre annotations yourself.</para>

      <para>The syntax of a cost centre annotation is</para>

      <programlisting>
     {-# SCC "name" #-} &lt;expression&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>where <literal>"name"</literal> is an arbitrary string,
      that will become the name of your cost centre as it appears
      in the profiling output, and
      <literal>&lt;expression&gt;</literal> is any Haskell
      expression.  An <literal>SCC</literal> annotation extends as
      far to the right as possible when parsing.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="prof-rules">
      <title>Rules for attributing costs</title>

      <para>The cost of evaluating any expression in your program is
      attributed to a cost-centre stack using the following rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the expression is part of the
	  <firstterm>one-off</firstterm> costs of evaluating the
	  enclosing top-level definition, then costs are attributed to
	  the stack of lexically enclosing <literal>SCC</literal>
	  annotations on top of the special <literal>CAF</literal>
	  cost-centre. </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Otherwise, costs are attributed to the stack of
	  lexically-enclosing <literal>SCC</literal> annotations,
	  appended to the cost-centre stack in effect at the
	  <firstterm>call site</firstterm> of the current top-level
	  definition<footnote> <para>The call-site is just the place
	  in the source code which mentions the particular function or
	  variable.</para></footnote>.  Notice that this is a recursive
	  definition.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Time spent in foreign code (see <xref linkend="ffi"/>)
	  is always attributed to the cost centre in force at the
	  Haskell call-site of the foreign function.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>What do we mean by one-off costs?  Well, Haskell is a lazy
      language, and certain expressions are only ever evaluated once.
      For example, if we write:</para>

      <programlisting>
x = nfib 25
</programlisting>

      <para>then <varname>x</varname> will only be evaluated once (if
      at all), and subsequent demands for <varname>x</varname> will
      immediately get to see the cached result.  The definition
      <varname>x</varname> is called a CAF (Constant Applicative
      Form), because it has no arguments.</para>

      <para>For the purposes of profiling, we say that the expression
      <literal>nfib 25</literal> belongs to the one-off costs of
      evaluating <varname>x</varname>.</para>

      <para>Since one-off costs aren't strictly speaking part of the
      call-graph of the program, they are attributed to a special
      top-level cost centre, <literal>CAF</literal>.  There may be one
      <literal>CAF</literal> cost centre for each module (the
      default), or one for each top-level definition with any one-off
      costs (this behaviour can be selected by giving GHC the
      <option>-caf-all</option> flag).</para>

    <sect2 id="retainer-prof">
      <title>Retainer Profiling</title>

      <para>Retainer profiling is designed to help answer questions
      like <quote>why is this data being retained?</quote>.  We start
      by defining what we mean by a retainer:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<para>A retainer is either the system stack, or an unevaluated
	closure (thunk).</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>In particular, constructors are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      retainers.</para>

      <para>An object B retains object A if (i) B is a retainer object and
     (ii) object A can be reached by recursively following pointers
     starting from object B, but not meeting any other retainer
     objects on the way. Each live object is retained by one or more
     retainer objects, collectively called its retainer set, or its
      <firstterm>retainer set</firstterm>, or its
      <firstterm>retainers</firstterm>.</para>

      <para>When retainer profiling is requested by giving the program
      the <option>-hr</option> option, a graph is generated which is
      broken down by retainer set.  A retainer set is displayed as a
      set of cost-centre stacks; because this is usually too large to
      fit on the profile graph, each retainer set is numbered and
      shown abbreviated on the graph along with its number, and the
      full list of retainer sets is dumped into the file
      <filename><replaceable>prog</replaceable>.prof</filename>.</para>

      <para>Retainer profiling requires multiple passes over the live
      heap in order to discover the full retainer set for each
      object, which can be quite slow.  So we set a limit on the
      maximum size of a retainer set, where all retainer sets larger
      than the maximum retainer set size are replaced by the special
      set <literal>MANY</literal>.  The maximum set size defaults to 8
      and can be altered with the <option>-R</option> RTS
      option:</para>

      </variablelist>

      <sect3>
	<title>Hints for using retainer profiling</title>

	<para>The definition of retainers is designed to reflect a
        common cause of space leaks: a large structure is retained by
        an unevaluated computation, and will be released once the
        computation is forced.  A good example is looking up a value in
        a finite map, where unless the lookup is forced in a timely
        manner the unevaluated lookup will cause the whole mapping to
        be retained.  These kind of space leaks can often be
        eliminated by forcing the relevant computations to be
        performed eagerly, using <literal>seq</literal> or strictness
        annotations on data constructor fields.</para>

	<para>Often a particular data structure is being retained by a
        chain of unevaluated closures, only the nearest of which will
        be reported by retainer profiling - for example A retains B, B
        retains C, and C retains a large structure.  There might be a
        large number of Bs but only a single A, so A is really the one
        we're interested in eliminating.  However, retainer profiling
        will in this case report B as the retainer of the large
        structure.  To move further up the chain of retainers, we can
        ask for another retainer profile but this time restrict the
        profile to B objects, so we get a profile of the retainers of
        B:</para>

<screen>
<replaceable>prog</replaceable> +RTS -hr -hcB
</screen>
	
	<para>This trick isn't foolproof, because there might be other
        B closures in the heap which aren't the retainers we are
        interested in, but we've found this to be a useful technique
        in most cases.</para>

    <sect2 id="biography-prof">
      <title>Biographical Profiling</title>

      <para>A typical heap object may be in one of the following four
      states at each point in its lifetime:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The <firstterm>lag</firstterm> stage, which is the

      <para>A biographical heap profile displays the portion of the
      live heap in each of the four states listed above.  Usually the
      most interesting states are the void and drag states: live heap
      in these states is more likely to be wasted space than heap in
      the lag or use states.</para>

      <para>It is also possible to break down the heap in one or more
      of these states by a different criteria, by restricting a
      profile by biography.  For example, to show the portion of the
      heap in the drag or void state by producer: </para>

<screen>
<replaceable>prog</replaceable> +RTS -hc -hbdrag,void
</screen>

      <para>Once you know the producer or the type of the heap in the
      drag or void states, the next step is usually to find the
      retainer(s):</para>

<screen>
<replaceable>prog</replaceable> +RTS -hr -hc<replaceable>cc</replaceable>...
</screen>

      <para>NOTE: this two stage process is required because GHC
      cannot currently profile using both biographical and retainer

    <sect2 id="mem-residency">
      <title>Actual memory residency</title>

      <para>How does the heap residency reported by the heap profiler relate to
	the actual memory residency of your program when you run it?  You might
	see a large discrepancy between the residency reported by the heap
	profiler, and the residency reported by tools on your system
	(eg. <literal>ps</literal> or <literal>top</literal> on Unix, or the
	Task Manager on Windows).  There are several reasons for this:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>There is an overhead of profiling itself, which is subtracted
	    from the residency figures by the profiler.  This overhead goes
	    away when compiling without profiling support, of course.  The
	    space overhead is currently 2 extra
	    words per heap object, which probably results in
	    about a 30% overhead.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Garbage collection requires more memory than the actual
	    residency.  The factor depends on the kind of garbage collection
	    algorithm in use:  a major GC in the standard
	    generation copying collector will usually require 3L bytes of
	    memory, where L is the amount of live data.  This is because by
	    default (see the <option>+RTS -F</option> option) we allow the old
	    generation to grow to twice its size (2L) before collecting it, and
	    we require additionally L bytes to copy the live data into.  When
	    using compacting collection (see the <option>+RTS -c</option>
	    option), this is reduced to 2L, and can further be reduced by
	    tweaking the <option>-F</option> option.  Also add the size of the
	    allocation area (currently a fixed 512Kb).</para>

      <title>Manipulating the hp file</title>

<para>(Notes kindly offered by Jan-Willhem Maessen.)</para>

<para>
The <filename>FOO.hp</filename> file produced when you ask for the
heap profile of a program <filename>FOO</filename> is a text file with a particularly
simple structure. Here's a representative example, with much of the
actual data omitted:
<screen>
JOB "FOO -hC"
DATE "Thu Dec 26 18:17 2002"
SAMPLE_UNIT "seconds"
VALUE_UNIT "bytes"
BEGIN_SAMPLE 0.00
END_SAMPLE 0.00
BEGIN_SAMPLE 15.07
  ... sample data ...
END_SAMPLE 15.07
BEGIN_SAMPLE 30.23
  ... sample data ...
END_SAMPLE 30.23
... etc.
BEGIN_SAMPLE 11695.47
END_SAMPLE 11695.47
</screen>
The first four lines (<literal>JOB</literal>, <literal>DATE</literal>, <literal>SAMPLE_UNIT</literal>, <literal>VALUE_UNIT</literal>) form a
header.  Each block of lines starting with <literal>BEGIN_SAMPLE</literal> and ending
with <literal>END_SAMPLE</literal> forms a single sample (you can think of this as a
vertical slice of your heap profile).  The hp2ps utility should accept
any input with a properly-formatted header followed by a series of
*complete* samples.
</para>
</sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Zooming in on regions of your profile</title>

<para>
You can look at particular regions of your profile simply by loading a
copy of the <filename>.hp</filename> file into a text editor and deleting the unwanted
samples.  The resulting <filename>.hp</filename> file can be run through <command>hp2ps</command> and viewed
or printed.
</para>
</sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Viewing the heap profile of a running program</title>

<para>
The <filename>.hp</filename> file is generated incrementally as your
program runs.  In principle, running <command>hp2ps</command> on the incomplete file
should produce a snapshot of your program's heap usage.  However, the
last sample in the file may be incomplete, causing <command>hp2ps</command> to fail.  If
you are using a machine with UNIX utilities installed, it's not too
hard to work around this problem (though the resulting command line
looks rather Byzantine):
<screen>
  head -`fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp | tail -1 | cut -d : -f 1` FOO.hp \
    | hp2ps > FOO.ps
</screen>

The command <command>fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp</command> finds the
end of every complete sample in <filename>FOO.hp</filename>, and labels each sample with
its ending line number.  We then select the line number of the last
complete sample using <command>tail</command> and <command>cut</command>.  This is used as a
parameter to <command>head</command>; the result is as if we deleted the final
incomplete sample from <filename>FOO.hp</filename>.  This results in a properly-formatted
.hp file which we feed directly to <command>hp2ps</command>.
</para>
</sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Viewing a heap profile in real time</title>

<para>
The <command>gv</command> and <command>ghostview</command> programs
have a "watch file" option can be used to view an up-to-date heap
profile of your program as it runs.  Simply generate an incremental
heap profile as described in the previous section.  Run <command>gv</command> on your
profile:
<screen>
  gv -watch -seascape FOO.ps 
</screen>
If you forget the <literal>-watch</literal> flag you can still select
"Watch file" from the "State" menu.  Now each time you generate a new
profile <filename>FOO.ps</filename> the view will update automatically.
</para>

<para>
This can all be encapsulated in a little script:
<screen>
  #!/bin/sh
  head -`fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp | tail -1 | cut -d : -f 1` FOO.hp \
    | hp2ps > FOO.ps
  gv -watch -seascape FOO.ps &amp;
  while [ 1 ] ; do
    sleep 10 # We generate a new profile every 10 seconds.
    head -`fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp | tail -1 | cut -d : -f 1` FOO.hp \
      | hp2ps > FOO.ps
  done
</screen>
Occasionally <command>gv</command> will choke as it tries to read an incomplete copy of
<filename>FOO.ps</filename> (because <command>hp2ps</command> is still running as an update
occurs).  A slightly more complicated script works around this
problem, by using the fact that sending a SIGHUP to gv will cause it
to re-read its input file:
<screen>
  #!/bin/sh
  head -`fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp | tail -1 | cut -d : -f 1` FOO.hp \
    | hp2ps > FOO.ps
  gv FOO.ps &amp;
  gvpsnum=$!
  while [ 1 ] ; do
    sleep 10
    head -`fgrep -n END_SAMPLE FOO.hp | tail -1 | cut -d : -f 1` FOO.hp \
      | hp2ps > FOO.ps
    kill -HUP $gvpsnum
  done    
</screen>
</para>

    <title>Using &ldquo;ticky-ticky&rdquo; profiling (for implementors)</title>
    <indexterm><primary>ticky-ticky profiling</primary></indexterm>

    <para>(ToDo: document properly.)</para>

    <para>It is possible to compile Glasgow Haskell programs so that
    they will count lots and lots of interesting things, e.g., number
    of updates, number of data constructors entered, etc., etc.  We
    call this &ldquo;ticky-ticky&rdquo;
    profiling,<indexterm><primary>ticky-ticky
    profiling</primary></indexterm> <indexterm><primary>profiling,
    ticky-ticky</primary></indexterm> because that's the sound a Sun4
    makes when it is running up all those counters
    (<emphasis>slowly</emphasis>).</para>

    <para>Ticky-ticky profiling is mainly intended for implementors;
    it is quite separate from the main &ldquo;cost-centre&rdquo;
    profiling system, intended for all users everywhere.</para>

    <para>To be able to use ticky-ticky profiling, you will need to
    have built the ticky RTS. (This should be described in 
    the building guide, but amounts to building the RTS with way
    "t" enabled.)</para>

    <para>To get your compiled program to spit out the ticky-ticky
    numbers, use a <option>-r</option> RTS
    option<indexterm><primary>-r RTS option</primary></indexterm>.
    See <xref linkend="runtime-control"/>.</para>

    <para>Compiling your program with the <option>-ticky</option>
    switch yields an executable that performs these counts.  Here is a
    sample ticky-ticky statistics file, generated by the invocation
    <command>foo +RTS -rfoo.ticky</command>.</para>

    <para>The formatting of the information above the row of asterisks
    is subject to change, but hopefully provides a useful
    human-readable summary.  Below the asterisks <emphasis>all
    counters</emphasis> maintained by the ticky-ticky system are
    dumped, in a format intended to be machine-readable: zero or more
    spaces, an integer, a space, the counter name, and a newline.</para>

    <para>In fact, not <emphasis>all</emphasis> counters are
    necessarily dumped; compile- or run-time flags can render certain
    counters invalid.  In this case, either the counter will simply
    not appear, or it will appear with a modified counter name,
    possibly along with an explanation for the omission (notice
    <literal>ENT&lowbar;PERM&lowbar;IND&lowbar;ctr</literal> appears
    with an inserted <literal>!</literal> above).  Software analysing
    this output should always check that it has the counters it
    expects.  Also, beware: some of the counters can have
