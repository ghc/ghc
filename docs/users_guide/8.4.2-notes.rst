TODO

Highlights

The highlights, since the 8.4.1 release, are:

- TODO


Full details
------------


Language
~~~~~~~~

- Fix a regression in which derived ``Read`` instances for record data types
  with field names ending with ``#`` (by way of :ghc-flag:`-XMagicHash`) would
  no longer parse valid output.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add the ``readFieldHash`` function to ``GHC.Read`` which behaves like
  ``readField``, but for a field that ends with a ``#`` symbol.

``integer-gmp`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Define ``powModSecInteger``, a "secure" version of ``powModInteger`` using
  the ``mpz_powm_sec`` function.

Build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~
