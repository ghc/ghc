Version 9.8.1
=============

Language
~~~~~~~~

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Added a new warning :ghc-flag:`-Wterm-variable-capture` that helps to make code compatible with
  the future extension ``RequiredTypeArguments``.

- Rewrite rules now support a limited form of higher order matching when a
  pattern variable is applied to distinct locally bound variables. For example: ::

      forall f. foo (\x -> f x)

  Now matches: ::

      foo (\x -> x*2 + x)

- GHC Proposal `#496
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0496-empty-record-wildcards.rst>`_
  has been implemented, allowing ``{..}`` syntax for constructors without fields, for consistency.
  This is convenient for TH code generation, as you can now uniformly use record wildcards
  regardless of number of fields.

- Incoherent instance applications are no longer specialised. The previous implementation of
  specialisation resulted in nondeterministic instance resolution in certain cases, breaking
  the specification described in the documentation of the `INCOHERENT` pragma. See GHC ticket
  #22448 for further details.

- Fix a bug in TH causing excessive calls to ``setNumCapabilities`` when ``-j`` is greater than ``-N``.
  See GHC ticket #23049.

- The ``-Wno-⟨wflag⟩``, ``-Werror=⟨wflag⟩`` and ``-Wwarn=⟨wflag⟩`` options are
  now defined systematically for all warning groups (for example,
  ``-Wno-default``, ``-Werror=unused-binds`` and ``-Wwarn=all`` are now
  accepted). See :ref:`options-sanity`.

- ``WARNING`` pragmas may now be annotated with a category, following
  `GHC proposal #541 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0541-warning-pragmas-with-categories.rst>`_, in which case they are controlled with new
  ``-Wx-⟨category⟩`` flags rather than :ghc-flag:`-Wdeprecations`.
  A new warning group :ghc-flag:`-Wextended-warnings` includes all such warnings
  regardless of category.  See :ref:`warning-deprecated-pragma`.

- GHC is now better at disambiguating record updates in the presence of duplicate
  record fields. The following program is now accepted ::

     {-# LANGUAGE DuplicateRecordFields #-}

     data R = MkR1 { foo :: Int }
            | MkR2 { bar :: Int }

     data S = MkS { foo :: Int, bar :: Int }

     blah x = x { foo = 5, bar = 6 }

  The point is that only the type S has a constructor with both fields "foo"
  and "bar", so this record update is unambiguous.

- Data types with ``deriving`` clauses now reject inferred instance contexts
  that mention ``TypeError`` constraints (see :ref:`custom-errors`), such as
  this one: ::

      newtype Foo = Foo Int

      class Bar a where
        bar :: a

      instance (TypeError (Text "Boo")) => Bar Foo where
        bar = undefined

      newtype Baz = Baz Foo
        deriving Bar

  Here, the derived ``Bar`` instance for ``Baz`` would look like this: ::

      instance TypeError (Text "Boo") => Bar Baz

  While GHC would accept this before, GHC 9.8 now rejects it, emitting "``Boo``"
  in the resulting error message. If you really want to derive this instance and
  defer the error to sites where the instance is used, you must do so manually
  with :extension:`StandaloneDeriving`, e.g. ::

      deriving instance TypeError (Text "Boo") => Bar Baz

GHCi
~~~~


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On POSIX systems that support timerfd, RTS shutdown no longer has to wait for
  the next RTS 'tick' to occur before continuing the shutdown process. See #22692.

``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Data.Tuple`` now exports ``getSolo :: Solo a -> a``.

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Primitive pointer comparison functions are now levity-polymorphic, e.g. ::

      sameArray# :: forall {l} (a :: TYPE (BoxedRep l)). Array# a -> Array# a -> Int#

  This change affects the following functions:

    - ``sameArray#``, ``sameMutableArray#``,
    - ``sameSmallArray#``, ``sameSmallMutableArray#``,
    - ``sameMutVar#``, ``sameTVar#``, ``sameMVar#``
    - ``sameIOPort#``, ``eqStableName#``.

``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``RecordUpd`` constructor of ``HsExpr`` now takes an ``HsRecUpdFields``
  instead of ``Either [LHsRecUpdField p] [LHsRecUpdProj p]``.
  Instead of ``Left ..``, use the constructor ``RegularRecUpdFields``, and instead
  of ``Right ..``, use the constructor ``OverloadedRecUpdFields``.

``ghc-heap`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``template-haskell`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Record fields now belong to separate ``NameSpace``s, keyed by the parent of
  the record field. This is the name of the first constructor of the parent type,
  even if this constructor does not have the field in question.
  This change enables TemplateHaskell support for ``DuplicateRecordFields``.
