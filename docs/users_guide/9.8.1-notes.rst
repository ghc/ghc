Version 9.8.1
=============

Language
~~~~~~~~

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Added a new warning :ghc-flag:`-Wterm-variable-capture` that helps to make code compatible with
  the future extension ``RequiredTypeArguments``.

- Rewrite rules now support a limited form of higher order matching when a
  pattern variable is applied to distinct locally bound variables. For example: ::

      forall f. foo (\x -> f x)

  Now matches: ::

      foo (\x -> x*2 + x)

- GHC Proposal `#496
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0496-empty-record-wildcards.rst>`_
  has been implemented, allowing ``{..}`` syntax for constructors without fields, for consistency.
  This is convenient for TH code generation, as you can now uniformly use record wildcards
  regardless of number of fields.

- Incoherent instance applications are no longer specialised. The previous implementation of
  specialisation resulted in nondeterministic instance resolution in certain cases, breaking
  the specification described in the documentation of the `INCOHERENT` pragma. See GHC ticket
  #22448 for further details.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On POSIX systems that support timerfd, RTS shutdown no longer has to wait for
  the next RTS 'tick' to occur before continuing the shutdown process. See #22692.

``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Primitive pointer comparison functions are now levity-polymorphic, e.g. ::

      sameArray# :: forall {l} (a :: TYPE (BoxedRep l)). Array# a -> Array# a -> Int#

  This change affects the following functions:

    - ``sameArray#``, ``sameMutableArray#``,
    - ``sameSmallArray#``, ``sameSmallMutableArray#``,
    - ``sameMutVar#``, ``sameTVar#``, ``sameMVar#``
    - ``sameIOPort#``, ``eqStableName#``.
