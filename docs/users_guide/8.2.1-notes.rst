Release notes for version 8.2.1
===============================

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed
in the following sections. There have also been numerous bug fixes and
performance improvements over the 8.0 branch.

Highlights
----------

The highlights since the 8.0 branch are:

- TODO FIXME
- SCC annotations can now be used for declarations.

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- Pattern synonym signatures can now be applied to multiple patterns, just like
  value-level binding signatures. See :ref:`patsyn-typing` for details.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- Old profiling flags ``-auto-all``, ``-auto``, and ``-caf-all`` are deprecated
  and their usage provokes a compile-time warning.

- Support for adding cost centres to declarations is added. The same `SCC`
  syntax can be used, in addition to a new form for specifying the cost centre
  name. See :ref:`scc-pragma` for examples.

- It is now possible to explicitly pick a strategy to use when deriving a
  class instance using the :ghc-flag:`-XDerivingStrategies` language extension
  (see :ref:`deriving-strategies`).

GHCi
~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- Added :ghc-flag:`-flocal-ghci-history` which uses current directory for `.ghci-history`.

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  Reifying types that contain unboxed tuples now works correctly. (Previously,
   Template Haskell reified unboxed tuples as boxed tuples with twice their
   appropriate arity.)

-  Splicing singleton unboxed tuple types (e.g., ``(# Int #)``) now works
   correctly. Previously, Template Haskell would implicitly remove the
   parentheses when splicing, which would turn ``(# Int #)`` into ``Int``.

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- The :ref:`heap profiler <prof-heap>` can now emit heap census data to the GHC
  event log, allowing heap profiles to be correlated with other tracing events
  (see :ghc-ticket:`11094`).

- Added NUMA support to Windows.

- Added processor group support for Windows. This allows the runtime to allocate
  threads to all cores in systems which have multiple processor groups.
  (e.g. > 64 cores, see :ghc-ticket:`11054`)

.. _lib-base:

base
~~~~

See ``changelog.md`` in the ``base`` package for full release notes.

-  Version number 4.10.0.0 (was 4.9.0.0)

- ``Data.Either`` now provides ``fromLeft`` and ``fromRight``

- ``Data.Type.Coercion`` now provides ``gcoerceWith``, which is analogous to
  ``gcastWith`` from ``Data.Type.Equality``.

- The ``Read1`` and ``Read2`` classes in ``Data.Functor.Classes`` have new
  methods, ``liftReadList(2)`` and ``liftReadListPrec(2)``, that are defined in
  terms of ``ReadPrec`` instead of ``ReadS``. This matches the interface
  provided in GHC's version of the ``Read`` class, and allows users to write
  more efficient ``Read1`` and ``Read2`` instances.

   should not be inlined.  It is optimized away after the simplifier runs.
