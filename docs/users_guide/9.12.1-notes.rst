Version 9.12.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.12>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~

- New language extension: :extension:`OrPatterns` implements `GHC Proposal #522
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst>`_).
- GHC Proposal `#569 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst>`_
  "Multiline string literals" has been implemented.
  The following code is now accepted by GHC::

    {-# LANGUAGE MultilineStrings #-}

    x :: String
    x =
      """
      This is a
      multiline

          string

      literal
      """

  This feature is guarded behind :extension:`MultilineStrings`.

- The ordering of variables used for visible type application has been changed in two cases.
  It is supposed to be left-to-right, but due to an oversight, it was wrong:

  - in an infix application ``f :: a `op` b``, it is now ``forall a op b.`` rather than
    ``forall op a b.``
  - in a linear type ``f :: a %m -> b``, it is now ``forall a m b.`` rather than
    ``forall a b m.``.

  This change is backwards-incompatible, although in practice we don't expect it
  to cause significant disruption.

- The built-in ``HasField`` class, used by :extension:`OverloadedRecordDot`, now
  supports representation polymorphism (implementing part of `GHC Proposal #583
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0583-hasfield-redesign.rst>`_).
  This means that code using :extension:`UnliftedDatatypes` or
  :extension:`UnliftedNewtypes` can now use :extension:`OverloadedRecordDot`.

- Unboxed ``Float#``/``Double#`` literals now support the HexFloatLiterals extension
  (`#22155 <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22155>`_).

- :extension:`UnliftedFFITypes`: GHC will now accept FFI types like: ``(# #) -> T`` where ``(# #)``
  is used as the one and only function argument.

- The venerable ``default`` declarations have been generalized. They can now name a class
  other than ``Num`` and the class defaults can be exported. The functionality is guarded
  by the new ``NamedDefaults`` language extension. See the `GHC proposal
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst>`__
  for details.

- GHC now takes COMPLETE pragmas into consideration when deciding whether
  pattern matches in do notation are fallible.

- As part of `GHC Proposal #281 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst>`_
  GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions, namely function type arrow ``a -> b``,
  constraint arrow ``a => b``, and ``forall`` telescopes: ::

    g = f (forall a. Show a => a -> String)
      where f :: forall a -> ...

- In accordance with `GHC Proposal #425 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0425-decl-invis-binders.rst>`_,
  GHC now permits wildcard binders in type declarations: ::

    type Const a b = a   -- before: the `b` had to be named even if unused on the RHS
    type Const a _ = a   -- now: the compiler accepts a wildcard binder `_`

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Constructor ``PluginProv`` of type ``UnivCoProvenance``, relevant
  for typing plugins, gets an extra ``DCoVarSet`` argument.
  The argument is intended to contain the in-scope coercion variables
  that the the proof represented by the coercion makes use of.
  See ``Note [The importance of tracking UnivCo dependencies]``
  in ``GHC.Core.TyCo.Rep``, :ref:`constraint-solving-with-plugins`
  and the migration guide.

- The flag :ghc-flag:`-fprof-late` will no longer prevent top level constructors from being statically allocated.

  It used to be the case that we would add a cost centre for bindings like ``foo = Just bar``.
  This turned the binding into a CAF that would allocate the constructor on first evaluation.

  However without the cost centre ``foo`` can be allocated at compile time. This reduces code-bloat and
  reduces overhead for short-running applications.

  The tradeoff is that calling ``whoCreated`` on top level value definitions like ``foo`` will be less informative.

- A new flag :ghc-flag:`-fexpose-overloaded-unfoldings` has been added providing a lightweight alternative to :ghc-flag:`-fexpose-all-unfoldings`.

- :ghc-flag:`-Wderiving-typeable` has been added to :ghc-flag:`-Wall`.

- i386 Windows support is now completely removed amid massive cleanup
  of legacy code to pave way for Arm64 Windows support (`#24883
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24883>`_). Rest
  assured, this does not impact existing support for x86_64 Windows or
  i386 Linux. For end users, the ``stdcall`` C calling convention is
  now fully deprecated and GHC will unconditionally produce a warning
  and treat it as ``ccall``. All C import/export declarations on
  Windows should now use ``ccall``.

- 32-bit macOS/iOS support has also been completely removed (`#24921
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24921>`_). This does
  not affect existing support of apple systems on x86_64/aarch64.

- The flag :ghc-flag:`-fignore-asserts` will now also enable the
  :extension:`CPP` macro ``__GLASGOW_HASKELL_ASSERTS_IGNORED__`` (`#24967
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24967>`_).
  This enables people to write their own custom assertion functions.
  See :ref:`assertions`.

- The flag :ghc-flag:`-fkeep-auto-rules` that forces GHC to keep auto generated
  specialization rules was added. It was actually added ghc-9.10.1 already but
  mistakenly not mentioned in the 9.10.1 changelog.

- Fixed a bug that caused GHC to panic when using the aarch64 ncg and -fregs-graph
  on certain programs. (#24941)

- A new warning :ghc-flag:`-Wview-pattern-signatures` is introduced to notify users about
  future changes in parsing of view patterns in combination with pattern signatures

- GHC now includes a new experimental flag, :ghc-flag:`-fobject-determinism`,
  which enables deterministic object code generation, with a minor trade-off in
  compilation speed (typically a 1-2% regression). Note, however, that this
  flag doesn't yet ensure determinism across all compilation configurations; we
  anticipate these cases will be addressed in future updates (:ghc-ticket:`12935`).

GHCi
~~~~

- Fix a bug where GHCi would not start alongside a local file called ``Prelude.hs``
  or ``Prelude.lhs`` (:ghc-ticket:`10920`).


Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reduce fragmentation incurred by the nonmoving GC's segment allocator. In one application this reduced resident set size by 26%. See :ghc-ticket:`24150`.

- Memory return logic now uses live bytes rather than live blocks to measure the size of the heap.
  This primarily affects the non-moving GC, which should now be more willing to return memory to the OS.
  Users who have fine-tuned the :rts-flag:`-F ⟨factor⟩`, :rts-flag:`-Fd ⟨factor⟩`, or :rts-flag:`-O ⟨size⟩` flags,
  and use the non-moving GC, should see if adjustments are needed in light of this change.

- The new runtime flag :rts-flag:`--read-tix-file=\<yes|no\>` allows to modify whether a preexisting .tix file is read in at the beginning of a program run.
  The default is currently ``--read-tix-file=yes`` but will change to ``--read-tix-file=no`` in a future version of GHC.
  For this reason, a warning is emitted if a .tix file is read in implicitly. You can silence this warning by explicitly passing ``--read-tix-file=yes``.
  Details can be found in `GHC proposal 612 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0612-fhpc-accumulation.md>`__.

``base`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Propagate HasCallStack from `errorCallWithCallStackException` to exception backtraces, fixing a bug in the implementation of `CLC proposal 164 <https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/164>`.

- Add exception type metadata to SomeException's displayException and
  "Exception:" header to the default handler
  (i.e. ``GHC.Conc.Sync.uncaughtExceptionHandler``):

  https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/231
  https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/261

- The `deprecation process of GHC.Pack <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21461>` has come its term. The module has now been removed from ``base``.

``ghc-prim`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Usage of deprecated primops is now correctly reported (#19629).
- New primops `isMutableByteArrayWeaklyPinned#` and `isByteArrayWeaklyPinned#`
  to allow users to avoid copying large arrays safely when dealing with ffi.
  See the users guide for more details on the different kinds of
  pinned arrays in 9.12.

  This need for this distinction originally surfaced in https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22255
