Version 9.12.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.12>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~


- The ordering of variables used for visible type application has been changed in two cases.
  It is supposed to be left-to-right, but due to an oversight, it was wrong:

  - in an infix application ``f :: a `op` b``, it is now ``forall a op b.`` rather than
    ``forall op a b.``
  - in a linear type ``f :: a %m -> b``, it is now ``forall a m b.`` rather than
    ``forall a b m.``.

  This change is backwards-incompatible, although in practice we don't expect it
  to cause significant disruption.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Constructor ``PluginProv`` of type ``UnivCoProvenance``, relevant
for typing plugins, gets an extra ``DCoVarSet`` argument.
The argument is intended to contain the in-scope coercion variables
that the the proof represented by the coercion makes use of.
See ``Note [The importance of tracking free coercion variables]``
in ``GHC.Core.TyCo.Rep``, :ref:`constraint-solving-with-plugins`
and the migration guide.
