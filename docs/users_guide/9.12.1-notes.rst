Version 9.12.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.12>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~

- New language extension: :extension:`OrPatterns` implements `GHC Proposal #522
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst>`_).

- The ordering of variables used for visible type application has been changed in two cases.
  It is supposed to be left-to-right, but due to an oversight, it was wrong:

  - in an infix application ``f :: a `op` b``, it is now ``forall a op b.`` rather than
    ``forall op a b.``
  - in a linear type ``f :: a %m -> b``, it is now ``forall a m b.`` rather than
    ``forall a b m.``.

  This change is backwards-incompatible, although in practice we don't expect it
  to cause significant disruption.

- The built-in ``HasField`` class, used by :extension:`OverloadedRecordDot`, now
  supports representation polymorphism (implementing part of `GHC Proposal #583
  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0583-hasfield-redesign.rst>`_).
  This means that code using :extension:`UnliftedDatatypes` or
  :extension:`UnliftedNewtypes` can now use :extension:`OverloadedRecordDot`.

- Unboxed ``Float#``/``Double#`` literals now support the HexFloatLiterals extension
  (`#22155 <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22155>`_).

- :extension:`UnliftedFFITypes`: GHC will now accept FFI types like: ``(# #) -> T`` where ``(# #)``
  is used as the one and only function argument.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- Constructor ``PluginProv`` of type ``UnivCoProvenance``, relevant
  for typing plugins, gets an extra ``DCoVarSet`` argument.
  The argument is intended to contain the in-scope coercion variables
  that the the proof represented by the coercion makes use of.
  See ``Note [The importance of tracking free coercion variables]``
  in ``GHC.Core.TyCo.Rep``, :ref:`constraint-solving-with-plugins`
  and the migration guide.

- The flag :ghc-flag:`-fprof-late` will no longer prevent top level constructors from being statically allocated.

  It used to be the case that we would add a cost centre for bindings like ``foo = Just bar``.
  This turned the binding into a CAF that would allocate the constructor on first evaluation.

  However without the cost centre ``foo`` can be allocated at compile time. This reduces code-bloat and
  reduces overhead for short-running applications.

  The tradeoff is that calling ``whoCreated`` on top level value definitions like ``foo`` will be less informative.

- A new flag :ghc-flag:`-fexpose-overloaded-unfoldings` has been added providing a lightweight alternative to :ghc-flag:`-fexpose-all-unfoldings`.

- :ghc-flag:`-Wderiving-typeable` has been added to :ghc-flag:`-Wall`.

- i386 Windows support is now completely removed amid massive cleanup
  of legacy code to pave way for Arm64 Windows support (`#24883
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24883>`_). Rest
  assured, this does not impact existing support for x86_64 Windows or
  i386 Linux. For end users, the ``stdcall`` C calling convention is
  now fully deprecated and GHC will unconditionally produce a warning
  and treat it as ``ccall``. All C import/export declarations on
  Windows should now use ``ccall``.

- 32-bit macOS/iOS support has also been completely removed (`#24921
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24921>`_). This does
  not affect existing support of apple systems on x86_64/aarch64.

- The flag :ghc-flag:`-fignore-asserts` will now also enable the 
  :extension:`CPP` macro ``__GLASGOW_HASKELL_ASSERTS_IGNORED__`` (`#24967
  <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/24967>`_).
  This enables people to write their own custom assertion functions.
  See :ref:`assertions`.
  

GHCi

Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Reduce fragmentation incurred by the nonmoving GC's segment allocator. In one application this reduced resident set size by 26%. See :ghc-ticket:`24150`.

- The new runtime flag :rts-flag:`--read-tix-file=\<yes|no\>` allows to modify whether a preexisting .tix file is read in at the beginning of a program run.
  The default is currently ``--read-tix-file=yes`` but will change to ``--read-tix-file=no`` in a future version of GHC.
  For this reason, a warning is emitted if a .tix file is read in implicitly. You can silence this warning by explicitly passing ``--read-tix-file=yes``.
  Details can be found in `GHC proposal 612 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0612-fhpc-accumulation.md>`__.
