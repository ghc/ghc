                By default, GHC has a new warning enabled,
                <literal>-fwarn-typed-holes</literal>, which causes the
                compiler to respond with the types of unbound
                variables it encounters in the source code. (It is
                reminiscient of the "holes" feature in languages such
                as Agda.)

                For more information, see <xref linkend="typed-holes"/>.

                GHC can now perform simple evaluation of type-level
                natural numbers, when using the
                <literal>DataKinds</literal> extension. For example,
                given a type-level constraint such as <literal>(x + 3)
                ~ 5</literal>, GHC is able to infer that
                <literal>x</literal> is 2. Similarly, GHC can now
                understand type-level identities such as <literal>x +
                0 ~ x</literal>.
           </para>

            <para>
                Note that the solving of these equations is only used
                to resolve unification variables - it does not
                generate new facts in the type checker. This is
                similar to how functional dependencies work.

                It is now possible to declare a 'closed' <literal>type
                family</literal> when using the
                <literal>TypeFamilies</literal> extension. A closed
                <literal>type family</literal> cannot have any
                instances created other than the ones in its
                definition.

                Use of the <literal>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</literal>
                extension is now subject to <emphasis>role checking</emphasis>,
                to ensure type safety of the derived instances. As this change
                increases the type safety of GHC, it is possible that some code
                that previously compiled will no longer work.

                GHC now supports overloading list literals using the new

                GHC now supports pattern synonyms, enabled by the
                <literal>-XPatternSynonym</literal> extension,
                allowing you to name and abstract over patterns more
                easily.

                There has been significant overhaul of the type
                inference engine and constraint solver, meaning it
                should be faster and use less memory.

                By default, GHC will now unbox all "small" strict
                fields in a data type. A "small" data type is one
                whose size is equivalent to or smaller than the native
                word size of the machine. This means you no longer
                have to specify <literal>UNPACK</literal> pragmas for
                e.g. strict <literal>Int</literal> fields. This also
                applies to floating-point values.

                GHC now has a brand-new I/O manager that scales significantly
                better for larger workloads compared to the previous one. It
                should scale linearly up to approximately 32 cores.

                The LLVM backend now supports 128- and 256-bit SIMD
                operations.

            <para>
                Note carefully: this is <emphasis>only</emphasis> available with

                The new code generator, after significant work by many
                individuals over the past several years, is now enabled by
                default. This is a complete rewrite of the STG to Cmm
                transformation. In general, your programs may get slightly
                faster.

                GHC now has substantially better support for cross
                compilation. In particular, GHC now has all the
                necessary patches to support cross compilation to
                Apple iOS, using the LLVM backend.

                PrimOps for comparing unboxed values now return

                New PrimOps for atomic memory operations.
                The <literal>casMutVar#</literal> PrimOp was introduced in
                GHC 7.2 (debugged in 7.4).  This release also includes additional
                PrimOps for compare-and-swap (<literal>casArray#</literal> and
                <literal>casIntArray#</literal>) and one for fetch-and-add
                (<literal>fetchAddIntArray#</literal>).

            <para>
                On Linux and Mac OS X, GHCi now uses the system
                dynamic linker by default, instead of its built in
                (static) object linker. This is more robust
                cross-platform, and fixes many long-standing bugs (for
                example: constructors and destructors, weak
                symbols, etc work correctly, and several edge cases in
                the RTS are fixed.)
           </para>

            <para>
                As a result of this, GHCi (and Template Haskell) must
                now load <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis> object files, not static
                ones. To assist this, there is a new compilation flag,
                <literal>-dynamic-too</literal>, which when used
                during compilation causes GHC to emit both static and
                dynamic object files at the same time. GHC itself
                still defaults to static linking.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note that Cabal will correctly handle
                <literal>-dynamic-too</literal> for you automatically,
                especially when <literal>-XTemplateHaskell</literal>
                is needed - but you <emphasis>must</emphasis> tell Cabal you are
                using the <literal>TemplateHaskell</literal>
                extension.
           </para>

            <para>
                Currently, Dynamic GHCi and
                <literal>-dynamic-too</literal> are not supported on
                Windows (32bit or 64bit.)

                <literal>Typeable</literal> is now poly-kinded, making
                <literal>Typeable1</literal>, <literal>Typeable2</literal>,
                etc., obsolete, deprecated, and relegated to
                <literal>Data.OldTypeable</literal>. Furthermore, user-written
                instances of <literal>Typeable</literal> are now disallowed:
                use <literal>deriving</literal> or the new extension
                <literal>-XAutoDeriveTypeable</literal>, which will create
                <literal>Typeable</literal> instances for every datatype
                declared in the module.

                GHC now has a parallel compilation driver. When
                compiling with <literal>--make</literal> (which is on
                by default,) you may also specify
                <literal>-jN</literal> in order to compile
                <replaceable>N</replaceable> modules in
                parallel. (Note: this will automatically scale on
                multicore machines without specifying <literal>+RTS
                -N</literal> to the compiler.)

                GHC now has support for a new pragma,
                <literal>{-# MINIMAL #-}</literal>, allowing you to
                explicitly declare the minimal complete definition of
                a class. Should an instance not provide the minimal
                required definitions, a warning will be emitted.

                In GHC 7.10, <literal>Applicative</literal> will
                become a superclass of <literal>Monad</literal>,
                potentially breaking a lot of user code. To ease this
                transition, GHC now generates warnings when
                definitions conflict with the Applicative-Monad
                Proposal (AMP).
           </para>

            <para>
                A warning is emitted if a type is an instance of
                <literal>Monad</literal> but not of
                <literal>Applicative</literal>,
                <literal>MonadPlus</literal> but not
                <literal>Alternative</literal>, and when a local
                function named <literal>join</literal>,
                <literal>&lt;*&gt;</literal> or <literal>pure</literal> is

           </para>

            <para>
                The warnings are enabled by default, and can be controlled

                Using the new <literal>InterruptibleFFI</literal>
                extension, it's possible to now declare a foreign

                to only <literal>safe</literal> or
                <literal>unsafe</literal>. An
                <literal>interruptible</literal> foreign call is the
                same as a <literal>safe</literal> call, but may be
                interrupted by asynchronous <emphasis>Haskell
                exceptions</emphasis>, such as those generated by

                GHC's internal compiler pipeline is now exposed
                through a <literal>Hooks</literal> module inside the
                GHC API. These hooks allow you to control most of the

                     The new pragma, <literal>{-# MINIMAL #-}</literal>,
                     allows to explicitly declare the minimal complete
                     definition of a class. Should an instance not provide
                     the minimal required definitions, a warning will be
                     emitted.

                    GHC can now build both static and dynamic object
                    files at the same time in a single compilation
                    pass, when given the
                    <literal>-dynamic-too</literal> flag. This will
                    produce both a statically-linkable
                    <literal>.o</literal> object file, and a
                    dynamically-linkable <literal>.dyn_o</literal>
                    file. The output suffix of the dynamic objects can
                    be controlled by the flag
                    <literal>-dynosuf</literal>.

                    <literal>ObjLink</literal> module.) Previously,
                    GHC would not unload the old object file, causing
                    a gradual memory leak as more objects were loaded
