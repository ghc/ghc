Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

* An issue where the wrong labels were used in the eventlog for events emitted when using info table profiling which was broken in 9.4.3. (:ghc-ticket:`22452`)
* Fix a long standing bug where invalid eventlogs would be produced with long command lines. (:ghc-ticket:`20221`)
* Fix another mistake in eta-expansion which resulted in serious performance regressions in 9.4.3.  (:ghc-ticket:`22424`)
* Fix the :ghc-flag:`-fdefer-diagnostics`. (:ghc-ticket:`22391`)
* Fixes to several subtle compiler panics. (:ghc-ticket:`22491`, :ghc-ticket:`22416`, :ghc-ticket:`22549`, :ghc-ticket:`22475`, :ghc-ticket:`22039`)
* Add correct write barries to IORef operations. (:ghc-ticket:`22468`)
* The toolchain provided with Windows binary distributions now searches for its own headers and libraries before those of the host system's msys2 installation (:ghc-ticket:`22561`)
