.. _extending-ghc:

Extending and using GHC as a Library
====================================

GHC exposes its internal APIs to users through the built-in ghc package.
It allows you to write programs that leverage GHC's entire compilation
driver, in order to analyze or compile Haskell code programmatically.
Furthermore, GHC gives users the ability to load compiler plugins during
compilation - modules which are allowed to view and change GHC's
internal intermediate representation, Core. Plugins are suitable for
things like experimental optimizations or analysis, and offer a lower
barrier of entry to compiler development for many common cases.

Furthermore, GHC offers a lightweight annotation mechanism that you can
use to annotate your source code with metadata, which you can later
inspect with either the compiler API or a compiler plugin.

.. _annotation-pragmas:

Source annotations
------------------

Annotations are small pragmas that allow you to attach data to
identifiers in source code, which are persisted when compiled. These
pieces of data can then inspected and utilized when using GHC as a
library or writing a compiler plugin.

.. _ann-pragma:

Annotating values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: ANN pragma
   single: pragma; ANN
   single: source annotations

Any expression that has both ``Typeable`` and ``Data`` instances may be
attached to a top-level value binding using an ``ANN`` pragma. In
particular, this means you can use ``ANN`` to annotate data constructors
(e.g. ``Just``) as well as normal values (e.g. ``take``). By way of
example, to annotate the function ``foo`` with the annotation
``Just "Hello"`` you would do this:

::

    {-# ANN foo (Just "Hello") #-}
    foo = ...

A number of restrictions apply to use of annotations:

-  The binder being annotated must be at the top level (i.e. no nested
   binders)

-  The binder being annotated must be declared in the current module

-  The expression you are annotating with must have a type with
   ``Typeable`` and ``Data`` instances

-  The :ref:`Template Haskell staging restrictions <th-usage>` apply to the
   expression being annotated with, so for example you cannot run a
   function from the module being compiled.

   To be precise, the annotation ``{-# ANN x e #-}`` is well staged if
   and only if ``$(e)`` would be (disregarding the usual type
   restrictions of the splice syntax, and the usual restriction on
   splicing inside a splice - ``$([|1|])`` is fine as an annotation,
   albeit redundant).

If you feel strongly that any of these restrictions are too onerous,
:ghc-wiki:`please give the GHC team a shout <MailingListsAndIRC>`.

However, apart from these restrictions, many things are allowed,
including expressions which are not fully evaluated! Annotation
expressions will be evaluated by the compiler just like Template Haskell
splices are. So, this annotation is fine:

::

    {-# ANN f SillyAnnotation { foo = (id 10) + $([| 20 |]), bar = 'f } #-}
    f = ...

.. _typeann-pragma:

Annotating types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: ANN pragma; on types

You can annotate types with the ``ANN`` pragma by using the ``type``
keyword. For example:

::

    {-# ANN type Foo (Just "A `Maybe String' annotation") #-}
    data Foo = ...

.. _modann-pragma:

Annotating modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: ANN pragma; on modules

You can annotate modules with the ``ANN`` pragma by using the ``module``
keyword. For example:

::

    {-# ANN module (Just "A `Maybe String' annotation") #-}

.. _ghc-as-a-library:

Using GHC as a Library
----------------------

The ``ghc`` package exposes most of GHC's frontend to users, and thus
allows you to write programs that leverage it. This library is actually
the same library used by GHC's internal, frontend compilation driver,
and thus allows you to write tools that programmatically compile source
code and inspect it. Such functionality is useful in order to write
things like IDE or refactoring tools. As a simple example, here's a
program which compiles a module, much like ghc itself does by default
when invoked:

::

    import GHC
    import GHC.Paths ( libdir )
    import DynFlags ( defaultLogAction )
     
    main = 
        defaultErrorHandler defaultLogAction $ do
          runGhc (Just libdir) $ do
            dflags <- getSessionDynFlags
            setSessionDynFlags dflags
            target <- guessTarget "test_main.hs" Nothing
            setTargets [target]
            load LoadAllTargets

The argument to ``runGhc`` is a bit tricky. GHC needs this to find its
libraries, so the argument must refer to the directory that is printed
by ``ghc --print-libdir`` for the same version of GHC that the program
is being compiled with. Above we therefore use the ``ghc-paths`` package
which provides this for us.

Compiling it results in:

.. code-block:: none

    $ cat test_main.hs
    main = putStrLn "hi"
    $ ghc -package ghc simple_ghc_api.hs
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( simple_ghc_api.hs, simple_ghc_api.o )
    Linking simple_ghc_api ...
    $ ./simple_ghc_api
    $ ./test_main 
    hi
    $

For more information on using the API, as well as more samples and
references, please see `this Haskell.org wiki
page <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/As_a_library>`__.

.. _compiler-plugins:

Compiler Plugins
----------------

GHC has the ability to load compiler plugins at compile time. The
feature is similar to the one provided by
`GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins>`__, and allows users to write
plugins that can adjust the behaviour of the constraint solver, inspect
and modify the compilation pipeline, as well as transform and inspect
GHC's intermediate language, Core. Plugins are suitable for experimental
analysis or optimization, and require no changes to GHC's source code to
use.

Plugins cannot optimize/inspect C-\\-, nor can they implement things like
parser/front-end modifications like GCC, apart from limited changes to
the constraint solver. If you feel strongly that any of these
restrictions are too onerous,
:ghc-wiki:`please give the GHC team a shout <MailingListsAndIRC>`.

.. _using-compiler-plugins:

Using compiler plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins can be specified on the command line with the
:ghc-flag:`-fplugin=⟨module⟩` option where ⟨module⟩ is a
module in a registered package that exports a plugin. Arguments can be given to
plugins with the :ghc-flag:`-fplugin-opt=⟨module⟩:⟨args⟩` option.

.. ghc-flag:: -fplugin=⟨module⟩
    :shortdesc: Load a plugin exported by a given module
    :type: dynamic
    :category: plugins

    Load the plugin in the given module. The module must be a member of a
    package registered in GHC's package database.

.. ghc-flag:: -fplugin-opt=⟨module⟩:⟨args⟩
    :shortdesc: Give arguments to a plugin module; module must be specified with
        :ghc-flag:`-fplugin=⟨module⟩`
    :type: dynamic
    :category: plugins

    Give arguments to a plugin module; module must be specified with
    :ghc-flag:`-fplugin=⟨module⟩`.


As an example, in order to load the plugin exported by ``Foo.Plugin`` in
the package ``foo-ghc-plugin``, and give it the parameter "baz", we
would invoke GHC like this:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ghc -fplugin Foo.Plugin -fplugin-opt Foo.Plugin:baz Test.hs
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Test.hs, Test.o )
    Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
    Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
    Loading package base ... linking ... done.
    Loading package ffi-1.0 ... linking ... done.
    Loading package foo-ghc-plugin-0.1 ... linking ... done.
    ...
    Linking Test ...
    $

Alternatively, core plugins can be specified with Template Haskell.

::

   addCorePlugin "Foo.Plugin"

This inserts the plugin as a core-to-core pass. Unlike `-fplugin=(module)`,
the plugin module can't reside in the same package as the module calling
:th-ref:`Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.addCorePlugin`. This way, the
implementation can expect the plugin to be built by the time
it is needed.

Plugin modules live in a separate namespace from
the user import namespace.  By default, these two namespaces are
the same; however, there are a few command line options which
control specifically plugin packages:

.. ghc-flag:: -plugin-package ⟨pkg⟩
    :shortdesc: Expose ⟨pkg⟩ for plugins
    :type: dynamic
    :category: plugins

    This option causes the installed package ⟨pkg⟩ to be exposed for plugins,
    such as :ghc-flag:`-fplugin=⟨module⟩`. The package ⟨pkg⟩ can be specified
    in full with its version number (e.g.  ``network-1.0``) or the version
    number can be omitted if there is only one version of the package
    installed. If there are multiple versions of ⟨pkg⟩ installed and
    :ghc-flag:`-hide-all-plugin-packages` was not specified, then all other
    versions will become hidden.  :ghc-flag:`-plugin-package ⟨pkg⟩` supports
    thinning and renaming described in :ref:`package-thinning-and-renaming`.

    Unlike :ghc-flag:`-package ⟨pkg⟩`, this option does NOT cause package ⟨pkg⟩
    to be linked into the resulting executable or shared object.

.. ghc-flag:: -plugin-package-id ⟨pkg-id⟩
    :shortdesc: Expose ⟨pkg-id⟩ for plugins
    :type: dynamic
    :category: plugins

    Exposes a package in the plugin namespace like :ghc-flag:`-plugin-package
    ⟨pkg⟩`, but the package is named by its installed package ID rather than by
    name.  This is a more robust way to name packages, and can be used to
    select packages that would otherwise be shadowed. Cabal passes
    :ghc-flag:`-plugin-package-id ⟨pkg-id⟩` flags to GHC.
    :ghc-flag:`-plugin-package-id ⟨pkg-id⟩` supports thinning and renaming
    described in :ref:`package-thinning-and-renaming`.

.. ghc-flag:: -hide-all-plugin-packages
    :shortdesc: Hide all packages for plugins by default
    :type: dynamic
    :category: plugins

    By default, all exposed packages in the normal, source import namespace are
    also available for plugins.  This causes those packages to be hidden by
    default.  If you use this flag, then any packages with plugins you require
    need to be explicitly exposed using :ghc-flag:`-plugin-package ⟨pkg⟩`
    options.

At the moment, the only way to specify a dependency on a plugin
in Cabal is to put it in ``build-depends`` (which uses the conventional
:ghc-flag:`-package-id ⟨unit-id⟩` flag); however, in the future there
will be a separate field for specifying plugin dependencies specifically.

.. _writing-compiler-plugins:

Writing compiler plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins are modules that export at least a single identifier,
``plugin``, of type ``GhcPlugins.Plugin``. All plugins should
``import GhcPlugins`` as it defines the interface to the compilation
pipeline.

A ``Plugin`` effectively holds a function which installs a compilation
pass into the compiler pipeline. By default there is the empty plugin
which does nothing, ``GhcPlugins.defaultPlugin``, which you should
override with record syntax to specify your installation function. Since
the exact fields of the ``Plugin`` type are open to change, this is the
best way to ensure your plugins will continue to work in the future with
minimal interface impact.

``Plugin`` exports a field, ``installCoreToDos`` which is a function of
type ``[CommandLineOption] -> [CoreToDo] -> CoreM [CoreToDo]``. A
``CommandLineOption`` is effectively just ``String``, and a ``CoreToDo``
is basically a function of type ``Core -> Core``. A ``CoreToDo`` gives
your pass a name and runs it over every compiled module when you invoke
GHC.

As a quick example, here is a simple plugin that just does nothing and
just returns the original compilation pipeline, unmodified, and says
'Hello':

::

    module DoNothing.Plugin (plugin) where
    import GhcPlugins

    plugin :: Plugin
    plugin = defaultPlugin {
      installCoreToDos = install
      }

    install :: [CommandLineOption] -> [CoreToDo] -> CoreM [CoreToDo]
    install _ todo = do
      putMsgS "Hello!"
      return todo

Provided you compiled this plugin and registered it in a package (with
cabal for instance,) you can then use it by just specifying
``-fplugin=DoNothing.Plugin`` on the command line, and during the
compilation you should see GHC say 'Hello'.

.. _core-plugins-in-more-detail:

Core plugins in more detail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``CoreToDo`` is effectively a data type that describes all the kinds of
optimization passes GHC does on Core. There are passes for
simplification, CSE, vectorisation, etc. There is a specific case for
plugins, ``CoreDoPluginPass :: String -> PluginPass -> CoreToDo`` which
should be what you always use when inserting your own pass into the
pipeline. The first parameter is the name of the plugin, and the second
is the pass you wish to insert.

``CoreM`` is a monad that all of the Core optimizations live and operate
inside of.

A plugin's installation function (``install`` in the above example)
takes a list of ``CoreToDo``\ s and returns a list of ``CoreToDo``.
Before GHC begins compiling modules, it enumerates all the needed
plugins you tell it to load, and runs all of their installation
functions, initially on a list of passes that GHC specifies itself.
After doing this for every plugin, the final list of passes is given to
the optimizer, and are run by simply going over the list in order.

You should be careful with your installation function, because the list
of passes you give back isn't questioned or double checked by GHC at the
time of this writing. An installation function like the following:

::

    install :: [CommandLineOption] -> [CoreToDo] -> CoreM [CoreToDo]
    install _ _ = return []

is certainly valid, but also certainly not what anyone really wants.

.. _manipulating-bindings:

Manipulating bindings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the last section we saw that besides a name, a ``CoreDoPluginPass``
takes a pass of type ``PluginPass``. A ``PluginPass`` is a synonym for
``(ModGuts -> CoreM ModGuts)``. ``ModGuts`` is a type that represents
the one module being compiled by GHC at any given time.

A ``ModGuts`` holds all of the module's top level bindings which we can
examine. These bindings are of type ``CoreBind`` and effectively
represent the binding of a name to body of code. Top-level module
bindings are part of a ``ModGuts`` in the field ``mg_binds``.
Implementing a pass that manipulates the top level bindings merely needs
to iterate over this field, and return a new ``ModGuts`` with an updated
``mg_binds`` field. Because this is such a common case, there is a
function provided named ``bindsOnlyPass`` which lifts a function of type
``([CoreBind] -> CoreM [CoreBind])`` to type
``(ModGuts -> CoreM ModGuts)``.

Continuing with our example from the last section, we can write a simple
plugin that just prints out the name of all the non-recursive bindings
in a module it compiles:

::

    module SayNames.Plugin (plugin) where
    import GhcPlugins

    plugin :: Plugin
    plugin = defaultPlugin {
      installCoreToDos = install
      }

    install :: [CommandLineOption] -> [CoreToDo] -> CoreM [CoreToDo]
    install _ todo = do
      return (CoreDoPluginPass "Say name" pass : todo)

    pass :: ModGuts -> CoreM ModGuts
    pass guts = do dflags <- getDynFlags
                   bindsOnlyPass (mapM (printBind dflags)) guts
      where printBind :: DynFlags -> CoreBind -> CoreM CoreBind
            printBind dflags bndr@(NonRec b _) = do
              putMsgS $ "Non-recursive binding named " ++ showSDoc dflags (ppr b)
              return bndr 
            printBind _ bndr = return bndr

.. _getting-annotations:

Using Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously we discussed annotation pragmas (:ref:`annotation-pragmas`),
which we mentioned could be used to give compiler plugins extra guidance
or information. Annotations for a module can be retrieved by a plugin,
but you must go through the modules ``ModGuts`` in order to get it.
Because annotations can be arbitrary instances of ``Data`` and
``Typeable``, you need to give a type annotation specifying the proper
type of data to retrieve from the interface file, and you need to make
sure the annotation type used by your users is the same one your plugin
uses. For this reason, we advise distributing annotations as part of the
package which also provides compiler plugins if possible.

To get the annotations of a single binder, you can use
``getAnnotations`` and specify the proper type. Here's an example that
will print out the name of any top-level non-recursive binding with the
``SomeAnn`` annotation:

::

    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
    module SayAnnNames.Plugin (plugin, SomeAnn(..)) where
    import GhcPlugins
    import Control.Monad (unless)
    import Data.Data

    data SomeAnn = SomeAnn deriving Data

    plugin :: Plugin
    plugin = defaultPlugin {
      installCoreToDos = install
      }

    install :: [CommandLineOption] -> [CoreToDo] -> CoreM [CoreToDo]
    install _ todo = do
      return (CoreDoPluginPass "Say name" pass : todo)

    pass :: ModGuts -> CoreM ModGuts
    pass g = do
              dflags <- getDynFlags
              mapM_ (printAnn dflags g) (mg_binds g) >> return g
      where printAnn :: DynFlags -> ModGuts -> CoreBind -> CoreM CoreBind
            printAnn dflags guts bndr@(NonRec b _) = do
              anns <- annotationsOn guts b :: CoreM [SomeAnn]
              unless (null anns) $ putMsgS $ "Annotated binding found: " ++  showSDoc dflags (ppr b)
              return bndr
            printAnn _ _ bndr = return bndr

    annotationsOn :: Data a => ModGuts -> CoreBndr -> CoreM [a]
    annotationsOn guts bndr = do
      anns <- getAnnotations deserializeWithData guts
      return $ lookupWithDefaultUFM anns [] (varUnique bndr)

Please see the GHC API documentation for more about how to use internal
APIs, etc.

.. _typechecker-plugins:

Typechecker plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to Core plugins, GHC has experimental support for
typechecker plugins, which allow the behaviour of the constraint solver
to be modified. For example, they make it possible to interface the
compiler to an SMT solver, in order to support a richer theory of
type-level arithmetic expressions than the theory built into GHC (see
:ref:`typelit-tyfuns`).

The ``Plugin`` type has a field ``tcPlugin`` of type
``[CommandLineOption] -> Maybe TcPlugin``, where the ``TcPlugin`` type
is defined thus:

::

    data TcPlugin = forall s . TcPlugin
      { tcPluginInit  :: TcPluginM s
      , tcPluginSolve :: s -> TcPluginSolver
      , tcPluginStop  :: s -> TcPluginM ()
      }

    type TcPluginSolver = [Ct] -> [Ct] -> [Ct] -> TcPluginM TcPluginResult

    data TcPluginResult = TcPluginContradiction [Ct] | TcPluginOk [(EvTerm,Ct)] [Ct]

(The details of this representation are subject to change as we gain
more experience writing typechecker plugins. It should not be assumed to
be stable between GHC releases.)

The basic idea is as follows:

-  When type checking a module, GHC calls ``tcPluginInit`` once before
   constraint solving starts. This allows the plugin to look things up
   in the context, initialise mutable state or open a connection to an
   external process (e.g. an external SMT solver). The plugin can return
   a result of any type it likes, and the result will be passed to the
   other two fields.

-  During constraint solving, GHC repeatedly calls ``tcPluginSolve``.
   This function is provided with the current set of constraints, and
   should return a ``TcPluginResult`` that indicates whether a
   contradiction was found or progress was made. If the plugin solver
   makes progress, GHC will re-start the constraint solving pipeline,
   looping until a fixed point is reached.

-  Finally, GHC calls ``tcPluginStop`` after constraint solving is
   finished, allowing the plugin to dispose of any resources it has
   allocated (e.g. terminating the SMT solver process).

Plugin code runs in the ``TcPluginM`` monad, which provides a restricted
interface to GHC API functionality that is relevant for typechecker
plugins, including ``IO`` and reading the environment. If you need
functionality that is not exposed in the ``TcPluginM`` module, you can
use ``unsafeTcPluginTcM :: TcM a -> TcPluginM a``, but are encouraged to
contact the GHC team to suggest additions to the interface. Note that
``TcPluginM`` can perform arbitrary IO via
``tcPluginIO :: IO a -> TcPluginM a``, although some care must be taken
with side effects (particularly in ``tcPluginSolve``). In general, it is
up to the plugin author to make sure that any IO they do is safe.

.. _constraint-solving-with-plugins:

Constraint solving with plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The key component of a typechecker plugin is a function of type
``TcPluginSolver``, like this:

::

    solve :: [Ct] -> [Ct] -> [Ct] -> TcPluginM TcPluginResult
    solve givens deriveds wanteds = ...

This function will be invoked at two points in the constraint solving
process: after simplification of given constraints, and after
unflattening of wanted constraints. The two phases can be distinguished
because the deriveds and wanteds will be empty in the first case. In
each case, the plugin should either

-  return ``TcPluginContradiction`` with a list of impossible
   constraints (which must be a subset of those passed in), so they can
   be turned into errors; or

-  return ``TcPluginOk`` with lists of solved and new constraints (the
   former must be a subset of those passed in and must be supplied with
   corresponding evidence terms).

If the plugin cannot make any progress, it should return
``TcPluginOk [] []``. Otherwise, if there were any new constraints, the
main constraint solver will be re-invoked to simplify them, then the
plugin will be invoked again. The plugin is responsible for making sure
that this process eventually terminates.

Plugins are provided with all available constraints (including
equalities and typeclass constraints), but it is easy for them to
discard those that are not relevant to their domain, because they need
return only those constraints for which they have made progress (either
by solving or contradicting them).

Constraints that have been solved by the plugin must be provided with
evidence in the form of an ``EvTerm`` of the type of the constraint.
This evidence is ignored for given and derived constraints, which GHC
"solves" simply by discarding them; typically this is used when they are
uninformative (e.g. reflexive equations). For wanted constraints, the
evidence will form part of the Core term that is generated after
typechecking, and can be checked by ``-dcore-lint``. It is possible for
the plugin to create equality axioms for use in evidence terms, but GHC
does not check their consistency, and inconsistent axiom sets may lead
to segfaults or other runtime misbehaviour.

.. _frontend_plugins:

Frontend plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A frontend plugin allows you to add new major modes to GHC.  You may prefer
this over a traditional program which calls the GHC API, as GHC manages a lot
of parsing flags and administrative nonsense which can be difficult to
manage manually.  To load a frontend plugin exported by ``Foo.FrontendPlugin``,
we just invoke GHC with the :ghc-flag:`--frontend ⟨module⟩` flag as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    $ ghc --frontend Foo.FrontendPlugin ...other options...

Frontend plugins, like compiler plugins, are exported by registered plugins.
However, unlike compiler modules, frontend plugins are modules that export
at least a single identifier ``frontendPlugin`` of type
``GhcPlugins.FrontendPlugin``.

``FrontendPlugin`` exports a field ``frontend``, which is a function
``[String] -> [(String, Maybe Phase)] -> Ghc ()``.  The first argument
is a list of extra flags passed to the frontend with ``-ffrontend-opt``;
the second argument is the list of arguments, usually source files
and module names to be compiled (the ``Phase`` indicates if an ``-x``
flag was set), and a frontend simply executes some operation in the
``Ghc`` monad (which, among other things, has a ``Session``).

As a quick example, here is a frontend plugin that prints the arguments that
were passed to it, and then exits.

::

    module DoNothing.FrontendPlugin (frontendPlugin) where
    import GhcPlugins

    frontendPlugin :: FrontendPlugin
    frontendPlugin = defaultFrontendPlugin {
      frontend = doNothing
      }

    doNothing :: [String] -> [(String, Maybe Phase)] -> Ghc ()
    doNothing flags args = do
        liftIO $ print flags
        liftIO $ print args

Provided you have compiled this plugin and registered it in a package,
you can just use it by specifying ``--frontend DoNothing.FrontendPlugin``
on the command line to GHC.
