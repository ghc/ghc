Runtime system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The GHC runtime linker now prefers user shared libraries above system ones.
  When extra search directories are specified these are searched before anything
  else. This fixes ``iuuc`` on Windows given the proper search directories (e.g
  ``-L/mingw64/lib``).

	- The GHC runtime linker now uses ``LIBRARY_PATH`` and the runtime loader now also
	  searches ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.
