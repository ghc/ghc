Version 9.2.1
==============

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- New '-Wredundant-bang-patterns' flag that enables checks for "dead" bangs.
  For instance, given this program: ::

      f :: Bool -> Bool
      f True = False
      f !x   = x

  GHC would report that the bang on ``x`` is redundant and can be removed
  since the argument was already forced in the first equation. For more
  details see :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-bang-patterns`
