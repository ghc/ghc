synopsis:       Shared functionality between GHC and the @template-haskell@
                library
description:    This library contains various bits shared between the @ghc@ and
                @template-haskell@ libraries.
                .
                This package exists to ensure that @template-haskell@ has a
                minimal set of transitive dependencies, since it is intended to
                be depended upon by user code.
