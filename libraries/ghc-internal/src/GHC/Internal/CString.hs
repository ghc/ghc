Note [String literals in GHC]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
String literals get quite a bit of special handling in GHC.  This Note
summarises the moving parts.

* Desugaring: see GHC.HsToCore.Match.Literal.dsLit, which in
  turn calls GHC.Core.Make.mkStringExprFS.

  The desugarer desugars the Haskell literal "foo" into Core
     GHC.Internal.CString.unpackCString# "foo"#
  where "foo"# is primitive string literal (of type Addr#).

  When the string cannot be encoded as a C string, we use UTF8:
     GHC.Internal.CString.unpackCStringUtf8# "foo"#

* The library module ghc-internal:GHC.Internal.CString has a bunch of functions that
  work over primitive strings, including GHC.Internal.CString.unpackCString#

* GHC.Core.Op.ConstantFold has some RULES that optimise certain string
  operations on literal strings. For example:

    + Constant folding the desugared form of ("foo" ++ "bar")
      into ("foobar")
    + Comparing strings
    + and more

* GHC.Internal.Base has a number of regular rules for String literals.

  + a rule "eqString": (==) @String = eqString
    where GHC.Internal.Base.eqString :: String -> String -> Bool

    ConstantFold has a RULE for eqString on literals:
     eqString (Lit "foo"#) (Lit "bar"#) --> False

    This allows compile time evaluation of things like "foo" == "bar"

  + A bunch of rules to promote fusion:

    "unpack"       [~1] forall a   . unpackCString# a             = build (unpackFoldrCString# a)
    "unpack-list"  [1]  forall a   . unpackFoldrCString# a (:) [] = unpackCString# a
    "unpack-append"     forall a n . unpackFoldrCString# a (:) n  = unpackAppendCString# a n

    And UTF8 variants of these rules.

* We allow primitive (unlifted) literal strings to be top-level
  bindings, breaking out usual rule.  See GHC.Core
  Note [Core top-level string literals]

* TODO: There is work on a special code-gen path for top-level boxed strings
     str :: [Char]
     str = unpackCString# "foo"#
  so that they can all share a common code pointer

  There is a WIP MR on gitlab for this: !3012

-- Unpacking C strings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This code is needed for virtually all programs, since it's used for
-- unpacking the strings of error messages.

{- Note [Inlining unpackCString#]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's really no point in ever inlining things like unpackCString# as the loop
doesn't specialise in an interesting way and we can't deforest the list
constructors (we'd want to use unpackFoldrCString# for this). Moreover, it's
pretty small, so there's a danger that it'll be inlined at every literal, which
is a waste.

Moreover, inlining early may interfere with a variety of rules that are supposed
to match unpackCString#,

 * BuiltInRules in GHC.Core.Opt.ConstantFold; e.g.
       eqString (unpackCString# (Lit s1)) (unpackCString# (Lit s2)
          = s1 == s2

 * unpacking rules; e.g. in GHC.Internal.Base,
       unpackCString# a
          = build (unpackFoldrCString# a)

 * stream fusion rules; e.g. in the `text` library,
       unstream (S.map safe (S.streamList (GHC.unpackCString# a)))
          = unpackCString# a

Moreover, we want to make it CONLIKE, so that:

* the rules in GHC.Core.Opt.ConstantFold will fire when the string is let-bound.
  E.g. the eqString rule in GHC.Core.Opt.ConstantFold
   eqString (unpackCString# (Lit s1)) (unpackCString# (Lit s2) = s1==s2

* exprIsConApp_maybe will see the string when we have
     let x = unpackCString# "foo"#
     ...(case x of algs)...

All of this goes for unpackCStringUtf8# too.

Note [Inlining of unpackFoldrCString]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usually the unpack-list rule turns unpackFoldrCString# into unpackCString#
It also has a BuiltInRule in PrelRules.hs:
     unpackFoldrCString# "foo" c (unpackFoldrCString# "baz" c n)
       =  unpackFoldrCString# "foobaz" c n

We use NOINLINE [0] on the grounds that, unlike
unpackCString#, there *is* some point in inlining
unpackFoldrCString#, because we get better code for the
higher-order function call.

This can cause a code size increase but it was minimal
when looking at nofib.

This is especially important for elem which then results in an
allocation free loop.

Note [unpackCString# iterating over addr]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When unpacking unpackCString# and friends repeatedly return a cons cell
containing:
* The current character we just unpacked.
* A thunk to unpack the rest of the string.

In order to minimize the size of the thunk we do not index of
the start of the string, offsetting into it, but instead increment
the addr and always use offset 0#.

This works since these two expressions will read from the same address.
* `indexCharOffAddr# a i`
* `indexCharOffAddr (a `plusAddr#` i) 0#`

This way we avoid the need for the thunks to close over both the start of
the string and the current offset, saving a word for each character unpacked.

This has the additional advantage the we can guarantee that only the
increment will happen in the loop.
