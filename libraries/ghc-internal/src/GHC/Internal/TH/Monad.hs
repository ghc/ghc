--
-- The longer story, is that 'Q' wraps an arbitrary 'Quasi'-able monad.
-- The perceptive reader notices that 'Quasi' has only two instances, 'Q'
-- itself and 'IO', neither of which have concrete implementations.'Q' plays
-- the trick of [dependency
-- inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle),

--
-- This function is primarily used in GHC internals, and for debugging
-- splices by running them in 'IO'.
--
-- Note that many functions in 'Q', such as 'reify' and other compiler
-- queries, are not supported when running 'Q' in 'IO'; these operations
-- simply fail at runtime. Indeed, the only operations guaranteed to succeed

-- * The @Monad m@ superclass is needed to stitch together the different
-- AST fragments.
-- * 'newName' is used when desugaring binding structures such as lambdas
-- to generate fresh names.
--
-- Therefore the type of an untyped quotation in GHC is `Quote m => m Exp`
--
-- For many years the type of a quotation was fixed to be `Q Exp` but by
-- more precisely specifying the minimal interface it enables the `Exp` to
-- be extracted purely from the quotation without interacting with `Q`.

  Generate a fresh name, which cannot be captured.

  For example, this:

  @f = $(do
    nm1 <- newName \"x\"
    let nm2 = 'mkName' \"x\"
    return ('LamE' ['VarP' nm1] (LamE [VarP nm2] ('VarE' nm1)))
   )@

  will produce the splice

  >f = \x0 -> \x -> x0

  In particular, the occurrence @VarE nm1@ refers to the binding @VarP nm1@,
  and is not captured by the binding @VarP nm2@.

  Although names generated by @newName@ cannot /be captured/, they can
  /capture/ other names. For example, this:

  >g = $(do
  >  nm1 <- newName "x"
  >  let nm2 = mkName "x"
  >  return (LamE [VarP nm2] (LamE [VarP nm1] (VarE nm2)))
  > )

  will produce the splice

  >g = \x -> \x0 -> x0

  since the occurrence @VarE nm2@ is captured by the innermost binding
  of @x@, namely @VarP nm1@.

{-
Note [Name lookup]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-}
{- $namelookup #namelookup#
The functions 'lookupTypeName' and 'lookupValueName' provide
a way to query the current splice's context for what names
are in scope. The function 'lookupTypeName' queries the type
namespace, whereas 'lookupValueName' queries the value namespace,
but the functions are otherwise identical.

A call @lookupValueName s@ will check if there is a value
with name @s@ in scope at the current splice's location. If
there is, the @Name@ of this value is returned;
if not, then @Nothing@ is returned.

The returned name cannot be \"captured\".
For example:

> f = "global"
> g = $( do
>          Just nm <- lookupValueName "f"
>          [| let f = "local" in $( varE nm ) |]

In this case, @g = \"global\"@; the call to @lookupValueName@
returned the global @f@, and this name was /not/ captured by
the local definition of @f@.

The lookup is performed in the context of the /top-level/ splice
being run. For example:

> f = "global"
> g = $( [| let f = "local" in
>            $(do
>                Just nm <- lookupValueName "f"
>                varE nm
>             ) |] )

Again in this example, @g = \"global\"@, because the call to
@lookupValueName@ queries the context of the outer-most @$(...)@.

Operators should be queried without any surrounding parentheses, like so:

> lookupValueName "+"

Qualified names are also supported, like so:

> lookupValueName "Prelude.+"
> lookupValueName "Prelude.map"

{- | 'reify' looks up information about the 'Name'. It will fail with
a compile error if the 'Name' is not visible. A 'Name' is visible if it is
imported or defined in a prior top-level declaration group. See the
documentation for 'newDeclarationGroup' for more details.

It is sometimes useful to construct the argument name using 'lookupTypeName' or 'lookupValueName'
to ensure that we are reifying from the right namespace. For instance, in this context:

> data D = D

which @D@ does @reify (mkName \"D\")@ return information about? (Answer: @D@-the-type, but don't rely on it.)
To ensure we get information about @D@-the-value, use 'lookupValueName':

> do
>   Just nm <- lookupValueName "D"
>   reify nm

and to get information about @D@-the-type, use 'lookupTypeName'.

example, if the function @foo@ has the fixity declaration @infixr 7 foo@, then

@bar@ does not have a fixity declaration, then @reifyFixity 'bar@ returns
'Nothing', so you may assume @bar@ has 'defaultFixity'.
-}

-}
reifyType :: Name -> Q Type
reifyType nm = Q (qReifyType nm)

{- | Template Haskell is capable of reifying information about types and
terms defined in previous declaration groups. Top-level declaration splices break up
declaration groups.

For an example, consider this  code block. We define a datatype @X@ and
then try to call 'reify' on the datatype.

@
module Check where

data X = X
    deriving Eq

$(do
    info <- reify ''X
    runIO $ print info
 )
@

This code fails to compile, noting that @X@ is not available for reification at the site of 'reify'. We can fix this by creating a new declaration group using an empty top-level splice:

@
data X = X
    deriving Eq

$(pure [])

$(do
    info <- reify ''X
    runIO $ print info
 )
@

We provide 'newDeclarationGroup' as a means of documenting this behavior
and providing a name for the pattern.

Since top level splices infer the presence of the @$( ... )@ brackets, we can also write:

@
data X = X
    deriving Eq

newDeclarationGroup

$(do
    info <- reify ''X
    runIO $ print info
 )
@

{- | @reifyInstances nm tys@ returns a list of all visible instances (see below for "visible")

if @nm@ is the name of a type class, then all instances of this class at the types @tys@

all instances of this family at the types @tys@ are returned.

Note that this is a \"shallow\" test; the declarations returned merely have
instance heads which unify with @nm tys@, they need not actually be satisfiable.

  - @reifyInstances ''Eq [ 'TupleT' 2 \``AppT`\` 'ConT' ''A \``AppT`\` 'ConT' ''B ]@ contains

  - @reifyInstances ''Show [ 'VarT' ('mkName' "a") ]@ produces every available
    instance of 'Show'

There is one edge case: @reifyInstances ''Typeable tys@ currently always
produces an empty list (no matter what @tys@ are given).

In principle, the *visible* instances are
* all instances defined in a prior top-level declaration group
  (see docs on @newDeclarationGroup@), or
* all instances defined in any module transitively imported by the
  module being compiled

However, actually searching all modules transitively below the one being
compiled is unreasonably expensive, so @reifyInstances@ will report only the
instance for modules that GHC has had some cause to visit during this
compilation.  This is a shortcoming: @reifyInstances@ might fail to report
instances for a type that is otherwise unusued, or instances defined in a
different component.  You can work around this shortcoming by explicitly importing the modules
whose instances you want to be visible. GHC issue <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20529#note_388980 #20529>
has some discussion around this.

{- | @reifyRoles nm@ returns the list of roles associated with the parameters
(both visible and invisible) of
the tycon @nm@. Fails if @nm@ cannot be found or is not a tycon.
The returned list should never contain 'InferR'.

An invisible parameter to a tycon is often a kind parameter. For example, if
we have

@
type Proxy :: forall k. k -> Type
data Proxy a = MkProxy
@

and @reifyRoles Proxy@, we will get @['NominalR', 'PhantomR']@. The 'NominalR' is
the role of the invisible @k@ parameter. Kind parameters are always nominal.
