Note [NOINLINE withSomeSNat]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The function

    withSomeSNat :: forall rep (r :: TYPE rep).
                    Natural -> (forall k. SNat k -> r) -> r

converts a `Natural` number to a singleton natural `SNat k`, where the `k` is
locally quantified in a continuation (hence the `forall k`). The local
quantification is important: we can manufacture an `SNat k` value, but it can
never be confused with (say) an `SNat 33` value, because we should never be
able to prove that `k ~ 33`. Moreover, if we call `withSomeSNat` twice, we'll
get an `SNat k1` value and an `SNat k2` value, but again we can't confuse them.
`SNat` is a singleton type!

But how to implement `withSomeSNat`? We have no way to make up a fresh type
variable. To do that we need `runExists`: see #19675.

Lacking `runExists`, we use a trick to implement `withSomeSNat`: instead of
generating a "fresh" type for each use of `withSomeSNat`, we simply use GHC's
placeholder type `Any` (of kind `Nat`), thus (in Core):

  withSomeSNat n f = f @T (UnsafeSNat @T n)
    where type T = Any @Nat

***  BUT we must mark `withSomeSNat` as NOINLINE! ***
(And the same for withSomeSSymbol and withSomeSChar in GHC.TypeLits.)

If we inline it we'll lose the type distinction between separate calls (those
"fresh" type variables just turn into `T`). And that can interact badly with
GHC's type-class specialiser. Consider this definition, where
`foo :: KnownNat n => blah`:

  ex :: Natural
  ex = withSomeSNat 1 (\(s1 :: SNat one) -> withKnownNat @one s1 $
       withSomeSNat 2 (\(s2 :: SNat two) -> withKnownNat @two s2 $
       foo @one ... + foo @two ...))

In the last line we have in scope two distinct dictionaries of types
`KnownNat one` and `KnownNat two`. The calls `foo @one` and `foo @two` each pick
out one of those dictionaries to pass to `foo`.

But if we inline `withSomeSNat` we'll get (switching to Core):

  ex = withKnownNat @T (UnsafeSNat @T 1) (\(kn1 :: KnownNat T) ->
       withKnownNat @T (UnsafeSNat @T 2) (\(kn2 :: KnownNat T) ->
       foo @T kn1 ... + foo @T kn2 ...))
    where type T = Any Nat

We are now treading on thin ice. We have two dictionaries `kn1` and `kn2`, both
of type `KnownNat T`, but with different implementations. GHC may specialise
`foo` at type `T` using one of these dictionaries and use that same
specialisation for the other. See #16586 for more examples of where something
like this has actually happened.

`KnownNat` should be a singleton type, but if we allow `withSomeSNat` to inline
it won't be a singleton type any more. We have lost the "fresh type variable".

TL;DR. We avoid this problem by making the definition of `withSomeSNat` opaque,
using an `NOINLINE` pragma. When we get `runExists` (#19675) we will be able to
stop using this hack.

{-
Note [Not exported decNat, decSymbol and decChar]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decNat, decSymbol and decChar are not (yet) exported.

There are two development paths:
1. export them.
2. Add `decideEquality :: f a -> f b -> Either (a :~: b -> Void) (a :~: b)`
   to the `Data.Type.Equality.TestEquality` typeclass.

The second option looks nicer given the current base API:
there aren't `eqNat :: SNat a -> SNat b -> Maybe (a :~: b)` like functions,
they are abstracted by `TestEquality` typeclass.

Also TestEquality class has a law that testEquality result
should be Just Refl iff the types applied to are equal:

testEquality (x :: f a) (y :: f b) = Just Refl  <=> a = b

As consequence we have that testEquality should be Nothing
iff the types applied are inequal:

testEquality (x :: f a) (y :: f b) = Nothing   <=> a /= b

And the decideEquality would enforce that.

However, adding a new method is a breaking change,
as default implementation cannot be (safely) provided.
Also there are unlawful instances of `TestEquality` out there,
(e.g. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parameterized-utils Index instance
      https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witness various types)
which makes adding unsafe default implementation a bad idea.

Adding own typeclass:

class TestEquality f => DecideEquality f where
  decideEquality :: f a -> f b -> Either (a :~: b -> Void) (a :~: b)

is bad design, as `TestEquality` already implies that it should be possible.
In other words, every f with (lawful) `TestEquality` instance should have
`DecideEquality` instance as well.

We hold on doing either 1. or 2. yet, as doing 2. is "harder",
but if it is done eventually, doing 1. is pointless.
In other words the paths can be thought as mutually exclusive.

Fortunately the dec* functions can be simulated using decide* variants
if needed, so there is no hurry to commit to either development paths.

-- Singleton values

-- | A value-level witness for a type-level natural number. This is commonly
-- referred to as a /singleton/ type, as for each @n@, there is a single value
-- that inhabits the type @'SNat' n@ (aside from bottom).
--
-- The definition of 'SNat' is intentionally left abstract. To obtain an 'SNat'
-- value, use one of the following:
--
-- 1. The 'natSing' method of 'KnownNat'.
--
-- 2. The @SNat@ pattern synonym.
--
-- 3. The 'withSomeSNat' function, which creates an 'SNat' from a 'Natural'
--    number.

{-
Note [Preventing unsafe coercions for singleton types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a singleton type like this one:

  newtype SNat (n :: Nat) = UnsafeSNat_ Natural

We operate under the fiction that a (non-bottom) value
``UnsafeSNat_ v :: SNat n`` also contains evidence that the value
``v :: Natural`` is the same as the type ``n :: Natural``.
Such evidence can only be safely ``coerce``d to evidence that the
value ``v`` is the same as some other type ``n2`` if we know that
``n ~ n2``, at nominal role. (This is #23454.)

So, to preserve that fiction, we:

 1. Provide a role annotation indicating that ``SNat``'s type argument has
    nominal role rather than the phantom role that would be inferred.
 2. Ensure that the real newtype constructor ``UnsafeSNat_`` is not
    exported even from ghc-internal.  Whenever that constructor is in
    scope, typechecking of ``coerce`` will ignore the role annotation
    and just unwrap the newtype.

But users may wish to write functions like this one (#23478):

  plusSNat :: SNat a -> SNat b -> SNat (a + b)

We could ask them to use ``unsafeCoerce``, but it seems a bit more polite
to provide a pattern synonym ``UnsafeSNat :: forall n. Natural -> SNat n``
as an escape hatch (exported from ghc-internal only), so that such a function
can be written as follows:

  plusSNat (UnsafeSNat x) (UnsafeSNat y) = UnsafeSNat (x + y)

Crucially, these pattern synonyms (unlike real newtype constructors) do not
cause ``coerce`` to bypass our role annotation when they are in scope.

To allow casting data structures containing SNats, we provide a
further escape hatch in ``unsafeWithSNatCo``, which enables ``coerce`` to
bypass our role annotation on ``SNat``, but /only within its argument/:

  unsafeWithSNatCo
    :: forall r. ((forall n. Coercible (SNat n) Natural) => r) -> r


The above reasoning applies identically for the other singleton types
'SChar' and 'SSymbol' as well.
