The overall structure of the GHC Prelude is a bit tricky.

  a) We want to avoid "orphan modules", i.e. ones with instance
        decls that don't belong either to a tycon or a class
        defined in the same module

  b) We want to avoid giant modules

So the rough structure is as follows, in (linearised) dependency order


GHC.Prim        Has no implementation.  It defines built-in things, and
                by importing it you bring them into scope.
                The source file is GHC.Prim.hi-boot, which is just
                copied to make GHC.Prim.hi

GHC.Internal.Base        Classes: Eq, Ord, Functor, Monad
                Types:   List, (), Int, Bool, Ordering, Char, String

GHC.Internal.Data.Tuple      Types: tuples, plus instances for GHC.Internal.Base classes

GHC.Internal.Show        Class: Show, plus instances for GHC.Base/GHC.Tup types

GHC.Internal.Enum        Class: Enum,  plus instances for GHC.Base/GHC.Tup types

GHC.Internal.Data.Maybe      Type: Maybe, plus instances for GHC.Internal.Base classes

GHC.Internal.List        List functions

GHC.Internal.Num         Class: Num, plus instances for Int
                Type:  Integer, plus instances for all classes so far (Eq, Ord, Num, Show)

                Integer is needed here because it is mentioned in the signature
                of 'fromInteger' in class Num

GHC.Internal.Real        Classes: Real, Integral, Fractional, RealFrac
                         plus instances for Int, Integer
                Types:  Ratio, Rational
                        plus instances for classes so far

                Rational is needed here because it is mentioned in the signature
                of 'toRational' in class Real

GHC.Internal.ST  The ST monad, instances and a few helper functions

Ix              Classes: Ix, plus instances for Int, Bool, Char, Integer, Ordering, tuples

GHC.Internal.Arr         Types: Array, MutableArray, MutableVar

                Arrays are used by a function in GHC.Internal.Float

GHC.Internal.Float       Classes: Floating, RealFloat
                Types:   Float, Double, plus instances of all classes so far

                This module contains everything to do with floating point.
                It is a big module (900 lines)
                With a bit of luck, many modules can be compiled without ever reading GHC.Internal.Float.hi


Other Prelude modules are much easier with fewer complex dependencies.

Note [Tracking dependencies on primitives]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When desugaring certain program constructs, GHC will insert references
to the primitives used to implement those constructs even if those
primitives have not actually been imported.  For example, the function
``fst (x,_) = x`` will be desugared using references to the 2-tuple
data constructor, which lives in GHC.Tuple.

When bootstrapping GHC, it is important that we do not attempt to
compile any such reference to GHC.Tuple before GHC.Tuple itself has
been built, otherwise compilation will fail with an error like this one:
    Failed to load interface for ‘GHC.Tuple’.
    There are files missing in the ‘ghc-prim-0.10.0’ package,
    try running 'ghc-pkg check'.
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.

To prevent such errors, we insist that if any boot library module X
implicitly depends on primitives in module Y, then the transitive
imports of X must include Y.

Such implicit dependencies can be introduced in at least the following ways:

W1:
  Common awkward dependencies:
   * TypeRep metadata introduces references to GHC.Types in EVERY module.
   * A String literal introduces a reference to GHC.CString, for either
     unpackCString# or unpackCStringUtf8# depending on its contents.
   * Tuple-notation introduces references to GHC.Tuple.
   * Constraint tuples introduce references to GHC.Classes.
   * Short lists like [3,8,2] produce references to GHC.Internal.Base.build

  A module can transitively depend on all of these by importing any of
  GHC.Internal.Base, GHC.Base, or Prelude.  The latter in particular
  means that an explicit import for this reason is only necessary when
  ImplicitPrelude is disabled, so this primarily comes up in the
  dependencies of base and in the compiler itself.

   * Most modules in ghc-internal import GHC.Internal.Base.
   * Most modules in compiler/ import GHC.Prelude, which imports Prelude.
   * Most hs-boot files that would otherwise have no imports can get
     away with just importing GHC.Types.

  Unfortunately, the requirement to transitively import these modules
  when they are implicitly used is obscure and causes only /intermittent/
  build failures, so enforcement of that requirement has historically
  been pretty spotty, causing issues like #23942.

  Improving this situation is discussed at #24520.

W2:
  Non-exhaustive pattern matches, incomplete record selectors,
  missing record fields, and missing class instance methods all
  introduce references to GHC.Internal.Control.Exception.Base.

  These constructs are therefore not allowed in ghc-prim or ghc-bignum.
  But since they generally have bad code smell and are avoided by
  developers anyway, this restriction has not been very burdensome.

W3:
  Various "overloaded" bits of syntax:
   * Overloaded integer literals introduce references to GHC.Internal.Num.
     * Likewise overloaded fractional literals to GHC.Internal.Real
     * Likewise overloaded string literals to GHC.Internal.Data.String
     * Likewise overloaded list literals to GHC.Internal.IsList
   * Overloaded labels introduce references to GHC.Internal.OverloadedLabels
   * Uses of OverloadedRecordDot introduce references to GHC.Internal.Records.
   * Do-notation introduces references to GHC.Internal.Base for Monad stuff.
     * Likewise arrow-notation to GHC.Internal.Control.Arrow
     * Likewise RecursiveDo stuff to GHC.Internal.Control.Monad.Fix
   * TemplateHaskell quotes introduce references to GHC.Internal.TH.Lib.

  These are not problematic in practice, because we do not make use of
  overloaded notation during bootstrap of GHC. Yet! If in the future we
  we decide to use TemplateHaskell in GHC or `ghc-internal`, we need to
  add explicit imports. To demonstrate that these errors can occur, consider
    e n = [| True |]
  which compiles with -XTemplateHaskell *without* requiring the user to
  import GHC.Internal.TH.Lib.

W4:
  Stock derived instances introduce references to various things.
  Derived Eq instances can reference GHC.Magic.dataToTag#, for example.
  But since any module containing a derived Eq instance must import Eq,
  as long as the module which defines Eq imports GHC.Magic this cannot
  cause trouble.

  A similar solution concerns the deriving of Lift instances with
  -XTemplateHaskell: A derived Lift instance must (transitively)
  import GHC.Internal.TH.Lift, where the Lift class is defined.
  The derived Lift instance references various identifiers in
  GHC.Internal.TH.Lib, so it is an import of GHC.Internal.TH.Lift.


W5:
  If no explicit "default" declaration is present, the assumed
  "default (Integer, Double)" creates a dependency on GHC.Num.Integer
  for the Integer type if defaulting is ever attempted during
  type-checking.  (This doesn't apply to hs-boot files, which can't
  be given "default" declarations anyway.)

W6:
  In the wasm backend, JSFFI imports and exports pull in a bunch of stuff;
  see Note [Desugaring JSFFI static export] and Note [Desugaring JSFFI import]
  in GHC.HsToCore.Foreign.Wasm.

A complete list could probably be made by going through the known-key
names in GHC.Builtin.Names and GHC.Builtin.Names.TH.  To test whether
the transitive imports are sufficient for any single module, instruct
the build system to build /only/ that module in stage 2.  For example,
a command to check whether the transitive imports for GHC.Internal.Maybe
are sufficient is:

  hadrian/build -o_checkDeps _checkDeps/stage1/libraries/ghc-internal/build/GHC/Internal/Maybe.o

Use the ".o-boot" suffix instead of ".o" to check an hs-boot file's
transitive imports.


Note [Semigroup stimes cycle]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Semigroup is defined in this module, GHC.Base, with the method
stimes :: (Semigroup a, Integral b) => b -> a -> a

This presents a problem.
* We use Integral methods (quot, rem) and Num methods (-) in stimes definitions
  in this module. Num is a superclass of Integral.
* Num is defined in GHC.Internal.Num, which imports GHC.Internal.Base.
* Enum is defined in GHC.Internal.Enum, which imports
  GHC.Internal.Base and GHC.Internal.Num. Enum is a superclass of
  Integral. We don't use any Enum methods here, but it is relevant
  (read on).
* Integral is defined in GHC.Internal.Real, which imports
  GHC.Internal.Base, GHC.Internal.Num, and GHC.Internal.Enum.

We resolve this web of dependencies with hs-boot files. The rules
https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/separate_compilation.html#how-to-compile-mutually-recursive-modules
require us to put either the full declarations or only the instance head for
classes in a hs-boot file.
So we put the full class decls for Num and Integral in Num.hs-boot and
Real.hs-boot respectively. This also forces us to have an Enum.hs-boot.

An obvious alternative is to move the class decls for Num, Enum, Real, and
Integral here. We don't do that because we would then need to move all the
instances (for Int, Word, Integer, etc.) here as well, or leave those instances
as orphans, which is generally bad.

We previously resolved this problem in a different way, with an hs-boot for
Semigroup.Internal that provided stimes implementations. This made them
impossible to inline or specialize when used in this module. We no longer have
that problem because we only import classes and not implementations.

Note: [List comprehensions and inlining]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The list monad operations are traditionally described in terms of concatMap:

xs >>= f = concatMap f xs

Similarly, mconcat for lists is just concat. Here in Base, however, we don't
have concatMap, and we'll refrain from adding it here so it won't have to be
hidden in imports. Instead, we use GHC's list comprehension desugaring
mechanism to define mconcat and the Applicative and Monad instances for lists.
We mark them INLINE because the inliner is not generally too keen to inline
build forms such as the ones these desugar to without our insistence.  Defining
these using list comprehensions instead of foldr has an additional potential
benefit, as described in compiler/GHC/HsToCore/ListComp.hs: if optimizations
needed to make foldr/build forms efficient are turned off, we'll get reasonably
efficient translations anyway.

{- | A type @f@ is a Functor if it provides a function @fmap@ which, given any types @a@ and @b@
lets you apply any function from @(a -> b)@ to turn an @f a@ into an @f b@, preserving the
structure of @f@. Furthermore @f@ needs to adhere to the following:

[Identity]    @'fmap' 'id' == 'id'@
[Composition] @'fmap' (f . g) == 'fmap' f . 'fmap' g@

Note, that the second law follows from the free theorem of the type 'fmap' and
the first law, so you need only check that the former condition holds.

class Functor f where
    -- | 'fmap' is used to apply a function of type @(a -> b)@ to a value of type @f a@,
    -- where f is a functor, to produce a value of type @f b@.
    -- Note that for any type constructor with more than one parameter (e.g., 'Either'),
    -- only the last type parameter can be modified with `fmap` (e.g., `b` in `Either a b`).
    --
    -- Some type constructors with two parameters or more have a @'Data.Bifunctor'@ instance that allows
    -- both the last and the penultimate parameters to be mapped over.
    --
    -- ==== __Examples__
    --
    -- Convert from a @'Data.Maybe.Maybe' Int@ to a @Maybe String@
    -- using 'Prelude.show':
    --

    --
    -- Apply 'Prelude.even' to the second element of a pair:
    --
    -- >>> fmap even (2,2)
    -- (2,True)
    --
    -- It may seem surprising that the function is only applied to the last element of the tuple
    -- compared to the list example above which applies it to every element in the list.
    -- To understand, remember that tuples are type constructors with multiple type parameters:
    -- a tuple of 3 elements @(a,b,c)@ can also be written @(,,) a b c@ and its @Functor@ instance
    -- is defined for @Functor ((,,) a b)@ (i.e., only the third parameter is free to be mapped over
    -- with @fmap@).

--      @('<*>') = 'liftA2' 'id'@
--
--      @'liftA2' f x y = f 'Prelude.<$>' x '<*>' y@
--
-- Further, any definition must satisfy the following:

--
-- [Interchange]
--
--      @u '<*>' 'pure' y = 'pure' ('$' y) '<*>' u@
--
--

--
--   * @u '*>' v = ('id' '<$' u) '<*>' v@

{- | The 'Monad' class defines the basic operations over a /monad/,
a concept from a branch of mathematics known as /category theory/.
From the perspective of a Haskell programmer, however, it is best to
think of a monad as an /abstract datatype/ of actions.
Haskell's @do@ expressions provide a convenient syntax for writing
monadic expressions.

Instances of 'Monad' should satisfy the following:

[Left identity]  @'return' a '>>=' k  =  k a@
[Right identity] @m '>>=' 'return'  =  m@
[Associativity]  @m '>>=' (\\x -> k x '>>=' h)  =  (m '>>=' k) '>>=' h@

Furthermore, the 'Monad' and 'Applicative' operations should relate as follows:

* @'pure' = 'return'@
* @m1 '<*>' m2 = m1 '>>=' (\\x1 -> m2 '>>=' (\\x2 -> 'return' (x1 x2)))@

The above laws imply:

* @'fmap' f xs  =  xs '>>=' 'return' . f@
* @('>>') = ('*>')@

and that 'pure' and ('<*>') satisfy the applicative functor laws.

The instances of 'Monad' for 'GHC.List.List', 'Data.Maybe.Maybe' and 'System.IO.IO'
defined in the "Prelude" satisfy these laws.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original Applicative/Monad proposal stated that after
implementation, the designated implementation of (>>) would become

  (>>) :: forall a b. m a -> m b -> m b
  (>>) = (*>)

by default. You might be inclined to change this to reflect the stated
proposal, but you really shouldn't! Why? Because people tend to define
such instances the /other/ way around: in particular, it is perfectly
legitimate to define an instance of Applicative (*>) in terms of (>>),
which would lead to an infinite loop for the default implementation of
Monad! And people do this in the wild.

This turned into a nasty bug that was tricky to track down, and rather
than eliminate it everywhere upstream, it's easier to just retain the
original default.

Originally, we defined

mapM f = sequence . map f

This relied on list fusion to produce efficient code for mapM, and led to
excessive allocation in cryptarithm2. Defining

sequence = mapM id

relies only on inlining a tiny function (id) and beta reduction, which tends to
be a more reliable aspect of simplification. Indeed, this does not lead to
similar problems in nofib.

{- Note [The rules for map]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rules for map work like this.

* Up to (but not including) phase 1, we use the "map" rule to
  rewrite all saturated applications of map with its build/fold
  form, hoping for fusion to happen.

  In phase 1 and 0, we switch off that rule, inline build, and
  switch on the "mapList" rule, which rewrites the foldr/mapFB
  thing back into plain map.

  It's important that these two rules aren't both active at once
  (along with build's unfolding) else we'd get an infinite loop
  in the rules.  Hence the activation control below.

* This same pattern is followed by many other functions:
  e.g. append, filter, iterate, repeat, etc. in GHC.Internal.List

  See also Note [Inline FB functions] in GHC.Internal.List

* The "mapFB" rule optimises compositions of map

-- Type Char and String
----------------------------------------------

-- | 'String' is an alias for a list of characters.
--
-- String constants in Haskell are values of type 'String'.
-- That means if you write a string literal like @"hello world"@,
-- it will have the type @[Char]@, which is the same as @String@.
--
-- __Note:__ You can ask the compiler to automatically infer different types
-- with the @-XOverloadedStrings@ language extension, for example
--  @"hello world" :: Text@. See t'Data.String.IsString' for more information.
--
-- Because @String@ is just a list of characters, you can use normal list functions
-- to do basic string manipulation. See "Data.List" for operations on lists.
--
-- === __Performance considerations__
--
-- @[Char]@ is a relatively memory-inefficient type.
-- It is a linked list of boxed word-size characters, internally it looks something like:
--
-- > ╭─────┬───┬──╮  ╭─────┬───┬──╮  ╭─────┬───┬──╮  ╭────╮
-- > │ (:) │   │ ─┼─>│ (:) │   │ ─┼─>│ (:) │   │ ─┼─>│ [] │
-- > ╰─────┴─┼─┴──╯  ╰─────┴─┼─┴──╯  ╰─────┴─┼─┴──╯  ╰────╯
-- >         v               v               v
-- >        'a'             'b'             'c'
--
-- The @String@ "abc" will use @5*3+1 = 16@ (in general @5n+1@)
-- words of space in memory.
--
-- Furthermore, operations like '(++)' (string concatenation) are @O(n)@
-- (in the left argument).
--
-- For historical reasons, the @base@ library uses @String@ in a lot of places
-- for the conceptual simplicity, but library code dealing with user-data
-- should use the [text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text)
-- package for Unicode text, or the the
-- [bytestring](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring) package

-- Note: Before base-4.19, ($) was not representation polymorphic
-- in both type parameters but only in the return type.
-- The generalization forced a change to the implementation,
-- changing its laziness, affecting expressions like (($) undefined): before
-- base-4.19 the expression (($) undefined) `seq` () was equivalent to
-- (\x -> undefined x) `seq` () and thus would just evaluate to (), but now
-- it is equivalent to undefined `seq` () which diverges.

{- | @'($)'@ is the __function application__ operator.

Applying @'($)'@ to a function @f@ and an argument @x@ gives the same result as applying @f@ to @x@ directly. The definition is akin to this:

@
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
($) f x = f x
@

This is @'id'@ specialized from @a -> a@ to @(a -> b) -> (a -> b)@ which by the associativity of @(->)@
is the same as @(a -> b) -> a -> b@.

On the face of it, this may appear pointless! But it's actually one of the most useful and important operators in Haskell.

The order of operations is very different between @($)@ and normal function application. Normal function application has precedence 10 - higher than any operator - and associates to the left. So these two definitions are equivalent:

@
expr = min 5 1 + 5
expr = ((min 5) 1) + 5
@

@($)@ has precedence 0 (the lowest) and associates to the right, so these are equivalent:

@
expr = min 5 $ 1 + 5
expr = (min 5) (1 + 5)
@

==== __Examples__

A common use cases of @($)@ is to avoid parentheses in complex expressions.

For example, instead of using nested parentheses in the following
 Haskell function:

@
-- | Sum numbers in a string: strSum "100  5 -7" == 98
strSum :: 'String' -> 'Int'
strSum s = 'sum' ('GHC.Internal.Data.Maybe.mapMaybe' 'GHC.Internal.Text.Read.readMaybe' ('words' s))
@

we can deploy the function application operator:

@
-- | Sum numbers in a string: strSum "100  5 -7" == 98
strSum :: 'String' -> 'Int'
strSum s = 'sum' '$' 'GHC.Internal.Data.Maybe.mapMaybe' 'GHC.Internal.Text.Read.readMaybe' '$' 'words' s
@

@($)@ is also used as a section (a partially applied operator), in order to indicate that we wish to apply some yet-unspecified function to a given value. For example, to apply the argument @5@ to a list of functions:

@
applyFive :: [Int]
applyFive = map ($ 5) [(+1), (2^)]
>>> [6, 32]
@

==== __Technical Remark (Representation Polymorphism)__

@($)@ is fully representation-polymorphic. This allows it to also be used with arguments of unlifted and even unboxed kinds, such as unboxed integers:

@
fastMod :: Int -> Int -> Int
fastMod (I# x) (I# m) = I# $ remInt# x m
