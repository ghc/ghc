0.3.7.0

	* Make division (/) on Scientifics slightly more efficient.

	* Fix the Show instance to surround negative numbers with parentheses when
	necessary.

	* Add (Template Haskell) Lift Scientific instance

	* Mark modules as Safe or Trustworthy (Safe Haskell).

0.3.6.2
	* Due to a regression introduced in 0.3.4.14 the RealFrac methods
	and floatingOrInteger became vulnerable to a space blowup when
	applied to scientifics with huge exponents. This has now been
	fixed again.

0.3.6.1
	* Fix build on GHC < 8.

0.3.6.0
	* Make the methods of the Hashable, Eq and Ord instances safe to
	use when applied to scientific numbers coming from untrusted
	sources. Previously these methods first converted their arguments
	to Rational before applying the operation. This is unsafe because
	converting a Scientific to a Rational could fill up all space and
	crash your program when the Scientific has a huge base10Exponent.

	Do note that the hash computation of the Hashable Scientific
	instance has been changed because of this improvement!

	Thanks to Tom Sydney Kerckhove (@NorfairKing) for pushing me to
	fix this.

	* fromRational :: Rational -> Scientific now throws an error
	instead of diverging when applied to a repeating decimal. This
	does mean it will consume space linear in the number of digits of
	the resulting scientific. This makes "fromRational" and the other
	Fractional methods "recip" and "/" a bit safer to use.

	* To get the old unsafe but more efficient behaviour the following
	function was added: unsafeFromRational :: Rational -> Scientific.

	* Add alternatives for fromRationalRepetend:

	  fromRationalRepetendLimited
	      :: Int -- ^ limit
	      -> Rational
	      -> Either (Scientific, Rational)
		        (Scientific, Maybe Int)

	  and:

	  fromRationalRepetendUnlimited
	      :: Rational -> (Scientific, Maybe Int)

	  Thanks to Ian Jeffries (@seagreen) for the idea.

0.3.5.3
	* Dropped upper version bounds of dependencies
	  because it's to much work to maintain.

0.3.5.2
	* Remove unused ghc-prim dependency.
	* Added unit tests for read and scientificP

0.3.5.1
	* Replace use of Vector from vector with Array from primitive.

0.3.5.0
	* Export scientificP :: ReadP Scientific
	  (Courtesy of Shlok Datye @shlok)

0.3.4.15
	* Fix build for base < 4.8.

0.3.4.14
	* Some minor performance improvements.

0.3.4.13
	* Support criterion-1.2

0.3.4.12
	* Support base-4.10

0.3.4.11
	* Support tasty-ant-xml-1.1.0

0.3.4.10
	* Tighten lower bound on vector from 0.5 to 0.7 because building with
	  vector < 0.7 results in a build error.

	* Move the internal modules Math.NumberTheory.Logarithms and
	  GHC.Integer.Logarithms.Compat to their own package integer-logarithms so
	  other people can share that code.

0.3.4.9
	* Support QuickCheck-2.9.

0.3.4.8
	* Make bytestring-builder's installation conditional based on a Cabal flag.

0.3.4.7
	* Unconditionally export Data.ByteString.Builder.Scientific.
	  The bytestring-builder cabal flag has been removed.
	  Depend on bytestring-builder for backwards compatibility for GHC < 7.8.

0.3.4.6
	* Made toDecimalDigits more similar to floatToDigits

	  Previously:

	    toDecimalDigits 0 == ([0],1)

	  Now:

	    toDecimalDigits 0 == ([0],0)

	  Because:

	    Numeric.floatToDigits 10 (0 :: Double) == ([0],0)


	* Introduce a special case for 0 in fromFloatDigits

	    fromFloatDigits 0 = 0

	  This should fix https://github.com/bos/aeson/issues/369

0.3.4.5
	The following are all a courtesy of Oleg Grenrus (phadej):

	* Support GHC-8.0.1
	* Support binary-0.8
	* Enable Travis continuous integration

0.3.4.4
	* Improved performance of toDecimalDigits by 13%.

0.3.4.1
	* Fix build on GHC-7.0.4

0.3.4.0
	* Added fromRationalRepetend & toRationalRepetend
	  for safely converting from and to rationals
	  which have a repeating decimal representation like:
	  1 % 28 = 0.03(571428).
	* Added a Binary instance.
	* Various performance improvements.
	* Support vector-0.11
	* Support tasty-0.11
	* Support criterion-1.1.0.0

0.3.3.8
	* Support QuickCheck-2.8.

0.3.3.7
	* Fixed both the

            Prelude Data.Scientific> reads "0.0" :: [(Data.Scientific.Scientific,String)]
            [(0.0,".0"),(0.0,"")]

          problem and the

            read " 8" :: Scientific fails, while read " 8" :: Double succeeds

	  problem.

0.3.3.6
	* Fixed bug in the x / y method for Scientific. Since I was using
	  the default implementation: `x * recip y` the operation would
	  diverge when `recip y` had an infinite decimal output.
	  This shouldn't happen when the result of / is finite again.
	  For example: 0.6 / 0.3 should yield 2.0.

	  This is now fixed by using the following implementation:

	  `x / y = fromRational $ toRational x / toRational y`

0.3.3.5
	* Fixed bug when converting the Scientific:
	  `scientific 0 someBigExponent` to a bounded Integral using toBoundedInteger
	  or to a bounded RealFloat using toBoundedRealFloat.
	  If someBigExponent was big enough to trigger the big-exponent protection
	  the beforementioned functions didn't return 0.

	  This is fixed by explicitly handling a coefficient of 0.

0.3.3.4
	* Relax upper version bounds of base and deepseq
	  for the test suite and benchmarks.

0.3.3.3
	* Add support for `deepseq-1.4`.

0.3.3.2
	* Fix parsing of empty digit string (#21).

0.3.3.1
	* Allow newer tasty, tasty-hunit and criterion.

0.3.2.2
	* Enable package to link with integer-simple instead of
	  integer-gmp using the -finteger-simple cabal flag.
	  Courtesy of @k0ral.

0.3.2.1

	* Parameterize inclusion of the Data.ByteString.Builder.Scientific
	  module using the bytestring-builder flag. Disabling this flag
	  allows building on GHC-7.0.4 which has bytestring-0.9 installed
	  by default.

0.3.2.0

	  instead. Also provide a manual normalize function.
	* Improve efficiency of toRealFloat
	* Added note about caching magnitudes
	* Dropped dependency on arithmoi
