{- | The 'foldM' function is analogous to 'foldl', except that its result is
encapsulated in a monad. Note that 'foldM' works from left-to-right over
the list arguments. This could be an issue where @('>>')@ and the `folded
function' are not commutative.

If right-to-left evaluation is required, the input list should be reversed.

Note [Worker/wrapper transform on replicateM/replicateM_]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementations of replicateM and replicateM_ both leverage the
worker/wrapper transform. The simpler implementation of replicateM_, as an
example, would be:

    replicateM_ 0 _ = pure ()
    replicateM_ n f = f *> replicateM_ (n - 1) f

However, the self-recursive nature of this implementation inhibits inlining,
which means we never get to specialise to the action (`f` in the code above).
By contrast, the implementation below with a local loop makes it possible to
inline the entire definition (as happens for foldr, for example) thereby
specialising for the particular action.

{- $naming

The functions in this library use the following naming conventions:

* A postfix \'@M@\' always stands for a function in the Kleisli category:
  The monad type constructor @m@ is added to function results
  (modulo currying) and nowhere else.  So, for example,

> filter  ::              (a ->   Bool) -> [a] ->   [a]
> filterM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]

* A postfix \'@_@\' changes the result type from @(m a)@ to @(m ())@.
  Thus, for example:

> sequence  :: Monad m => [m a] -> m [a]
> sequence_ :: Monad m => [m a] -> m ()

* A prefix \'@m@\' generalizes an existing function to a monadic form.
  Thus, for example:

> sum  :: Num a       => [a]   -> a
> msum :: MonadPlus m => [m a] -> m a
