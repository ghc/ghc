     -- |  GHC note: a 'Handle' will be automatically closed when the garbage
     -- collector detects that it has become unreferenced by the program.
     -- However, relying on this behaviour is not generally recommended:
     -- the garbage collector is unpredictable.  If possible, use
     -- an explicit 'hClose' to close 'Handle's when they are no longer
     -- required.  GHC does not currently attempt to free up file
     -- descriptors when they have run out, it is your responsibility to
     -- ensure that this doesn't happen.

     -- |  A text-mode 'Handle' has an associated 'TextEncoding', which
     -- is used to decode bytes into Unicode characters when reading,
     -- and encode Unicode characters into bytes when writing.
     --
     -- The default 'TextEncoding' is the same as the default encoding
     -- on your system, which is also available as 'localeEncoding'.
     -- (GHC note: on Windows, we currently do not support double-byte
     -- encodings; if the console\'s code page is unsupported, then
     -- 'localeEncoding' will be 'latin1'.)
     --
     -- Encoding and decoding errors are always detected and reported,
     -- except during lazy I/O ('hGetContents', 'getContents', and
     -- 'readFile'), where a decoding error merely results in
     -- termination of the character stream, as with other I/O errors.

     -- *  Newline conversion
     -- | In Haskell, a newline is always represented by the character
     -- @\'\\n\'@.  However, in files and external character streams, a
     -- newline may be represented by another character sequence, such
     -- as @\'\\r\\n\'@.
     --
     -- A text-mode 'Handle' has an associated 'NewlineMode' that
     -- specifies how to translate newline characters.  The
     -- 'NewlineMode' specifies the input and output translation
     -- separately, so that for instance you can translate @\'\\r\\n\'@
     -- to @\'\\n\'@ on input, but leave newlines as @\'\\n\'@ on output.
     --
     -- The default 'NewlineMode' for a 'Handle' is
     -- 'nativeNewlineMode', which does no translation on Unix systems,
     -- but translates @\'\\r\\n\'@ to @\'\\n\'@ and back on Windows.
     --
     -- Binary-mode 'Handle's do no newline translation at all.

-- $locking
-- Implementations should enforce as far as possible, at least locally to the
-- Haskell process, multiple-reader single-writer locking on files.
-- That is, /there may either be many handles on the same file which manage input, or just one handle on the file which manages output/.  If any
-- open or semi-closed handle is managing a file for output, no new
-- handle can be allocated for that file.  If any open or semi-closed
-- handle is managing a file for input, new handles can only be allocated
-- if they do not manage output.  Whether two files are the same is
-- implementation-dependent, but they should normally be the same if they
-- have the same absolute path name and neither has been renamed, for
-- example.
--
-- /Warning/: the 'readFile' operation holds a semi-closed handle on
-- the file until the entire contents of the file have been consumed.
-- It follows that an attempt to write to a file (using 'writeFile', for
-- example) that was earlier opened by 'readFile' will usually result in
-- failure with 'GHC.Internal.System.IO.Error.isAlreadyInUseError'.

-- $stdio_examples
-- Note: Some of the examples in this module do not work "as is" in ghci.
-- This is because using 'stdin' in combination with lazy IO
-- does not work well in interactive mode.
--
-- Lines starting with @>@ indicate 'stdin' and @^D@ signales EOF.

-- ==== __Example__

-- ghci> foo
-- > input
-- output
-- > input^D
-- output
