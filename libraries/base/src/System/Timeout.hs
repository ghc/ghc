-- |Wrap an 'IO' computation to time out and return @Nothing@ in case no result
-- is available within @n@ microseconds (@1\/10^6@ seconds). In case a result
-- is available before the timeout expires, @Just a@ is returned. A negative
-- timeout interval means \"wait indefinitely\". When specifying long timeouts,
-- be careful not to exceed @maxBound :: Int@, which on 32-bit machines is only
-- 2147483647 Î¼s, less than 36 minutes.
-- Consider using @Control.Concurrent.Timeout.timeout@ from @unbounded-delays@ package.
--
-- >>> timeout 1000000 (threadDelay 1000 *> pure "finished on time")
-- Just "finished on time"
--
-- >>> timeout 10000 (threadDelay 100000 *> pure "finished on time")
-- Nothing
--
-- The design of this combinator was guided by the objective that @timeout n f@
-- should behave exactly the same as @f@ as long as @f@ doesn't time out. This
-- means that @f@ has the same 'myThreadId' it would have without the timeout
-- wrapper. Any exceptions @f@ might throw cancel the timeout and propagate
-- further up. It also possible for @f@ to receive exceptions thrown to it by
-- another thread.
--
-- A tricky implementation detail is the question of how to abort an @IO@
-- computation. This combinator relies on asynchronous exceptions internally
-- (namely throwing the computation the 'Timeout' exception).  The technique
-- works very well for computations executing inside of the Haskell runtime
-- system, but it doesn't work at all for non-Haskell code.  Foreign function
-- calls, for example, cannot be timed out with this combinator simply because
-- an arbitrary C function cannot receive asynchronous exceptions. When
-- @timeout@ is used to wrap an FFI call that blocks, no timeout event can be
-- delivered until the FFI call returns, which pretty much negates the purpose
-- of the combinator. In practice, however, this limitation is less severe than
-- it may sound. Standard I\/O functions like 'GHC.Internal.System.IO.hGetBuf',
-- 'GHC.Internal.System.IO.hPutBuf', Network.Socket.accept, or 'GHC.Internal.System.IO.hWaitForInput'
-- appear to be blocking, but they really don't because the runtime system uses
-- scheduling mechanisms like @select(2)@ to perform asynchronous I\/O, so it
-- is possible to interrupt standard socket I\/O or file I\/O using this
-- combinator.
---
-- Note that 'timeout' cancels the computation by throwing it the 'Timeout'
-- exception. Consequently blanket exception handlers (e.g. catching
-- 'SomeException') within the computation will break the timeout behavior.
