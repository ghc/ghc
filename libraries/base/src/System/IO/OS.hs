    The 'withHandle_'' operation, which we use here, already performs masking.
    Still, we have to employ 'mask', in order do obtain the operation that
    restores the original masking state. The user-provided action should be
    executed with this original masking state, as there is no inherent reason to
    generally perform it with masking in place. The masking that 'withHandle_''
    performs is only for safely accessing handle state and thus constitutes an
    implementation detail; it has nothing to do with the user-provided action.

-- ** Caveats

{-$with-ref-caveats
    #with-ref-caveats#There are the following caveats regarding the above
    operations:

      * Flushing of buffers can fail if the given handle is readable but not
        seekable.

      * If one of these operations is performed as part of an action executed by
        'System.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO',
        'System.IO.Unsafe.unsafeInterleaveIO', or one of their “dupable”
        variants and the user-provided action receives an asychnchronous
        exception and does not catch it, then the following happens:

          - Before the overall computation is suspended, the blocking of handle
            operations is removed.

          - When the computation is later resumed due to another evaluation
            attempt, the blocking of handle operations is reinstantiated, the
            Haskell-managed buffers are flushed again, and the user-provided
            action is run from the beginning.

        Repeating the previously executed part of the user-provided action
        cannot be avoided apparently. See the @[async]@ note in the source code
        of "GHC.Internal.IO.Handle.Internals" for further explanation.
