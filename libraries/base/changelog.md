# Changelog for [`base` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base)

## 4.11.0.0 *TBA*
  * Bundled with GHC *TBA*

  * Add `Alternative` instance for `ZipList` (#13520)

  * Add instances `Num`, `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, `Semigroup`
    and `Monoid` for `Data.Ord.Down` (#13097).

  * Add `infixl 9 !!` declaration for `Data.List.NonEmpty.!!`

  * Add `<&>` operator to `Data.Functor` (#14029)

  * Remove the deprecated `Typeable{1..7}` type synonyms (#14047)

  * Add instances `Semigroup` and `Monoid` for `Control.Monad.ST` (#14107).

  * The `Read` instances for `Proxy`, `Coercion`, `(:~:)`, `(:~~:)`, and `U1`
    now ignore the parsing precedence. The effect of this is that `read` will
    be able to successfully parse more strings containing `"Proxy"` _et al._
    without surrounding parentheses (e.g., `"Thing Proxy"`) (#12874).

  * Add `iterate'`, a strict version of `iterate`, to `Data.List`
    and `Data.OldList` (#3474)

## 4.10.0.0 *April 2017*
  * Bundled with GHC *TBA*

  * `Data.Type.Bool.Not` given a type family dependency (#12057).

  * `Foreign.Ptr` now exports the constructors for `IntPtr` and `WordPtr`
    (#11983)

  * `Generic1`, as well as the associated datatypes and typeclasses in
    `GHC.Generics`, are now poly-kinded (#10604)

  * `New modules `Data.Bifoldable` and `Data.Bitraversable` (previously defined
    in the `bifunctors` package) (#10448)

  * `Data.Either` now provides `fromLeft` and `fromRight` (#12402)

  * `Data.Type.Coercion` now provides `gcoerceWith` (#12493)

  * New methods `liftReadList(2)` and `liftReadListPrec(2)` in the
    `Read1`/`Read2` classes that are defined in terms of `ReadPrec` instead of
    `ReadS`, as well as related combinators, have been added to
    `Data.Functor.Classes` (#12358)

  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `IO`, as well as for `Event` and `Lifetime`
    from `GHC.Event` (#12464)

  * Add `Data` instance for `Const` (#12438)

  * Added `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1` and `Show1` instances for `NonEmpty`.

  * Add wrappers for `blksize_t`, `blkcnt_t`, `clockid_t`, `fsblkcnt_t`,
    `fsfilcnt_t`, `id_t`, `key_t`, and `timer_t` to System.Posix.Types (#12795)

  * Add `CBool`, a wrapper around C's `bool` type, to `Foreign.C.Types`
    (#13136)

  * Raw buffer operations in `GHC.IO.FD` are now strict in the buffer, offset, and length operations (#9696)

  * Add `plusForeignPtr` to `Foreign.ForeignPtr`.

  * Add `type family AppendSymbol (m :: Symbol) (n :: Symbol) :: Symbol` to `GHC.TypeLits`
    (#12162)

  * Add `GHC.TypeNats` module with `Natural`-based `KnownNat`. The `Nat`
    operations in `GHC.TypeLits` are a thin compatibility layer on top.
    Note: the `KnownNat` evidence is changed from an `Integer` to a `Natural`.

  * The type of `asProxyTypeOf` in `Data.Proxy` has been generalized (#12805)

  * `liftA2` is now a method of the `Applicative` class. `liftA2` and
    `<*>` each have a default implementation based on the other. Various
    library functions have been updated to use `liftA2` where it might offer
    some benefit. `liftA2` is not yet in the `Prelude`, and must currently be
    imported from `Control.Applicative`. It is likely to be added to the
    `Prelude` in the future. (#13191)

  * A new module, `Type.Reflection`, exposing GHC's new type-indexed type
    representation mechanism is now provided.

  * `Data.Dynamic` now exports the `Dyn` data constructor, enabled by the new
    type-indexed type representation mechanism.

  * `Data.Type.Equality` now provides a kind heterogeneous type equality
    evidence type, `(:~~:)`.

  * The `CostCentresXML` constructor of `GHC.RTS.Flags.DoCostCentres` has been
    replaced by `CostCentresJSON` due to the new JSON export format supported by
    the cost centre profiler.

  * The `ErrorCall` pattern synonym has been given a `COMPLETE` pragma so that
    functions which solely match again `ErrorCall` do not produce
    non-exhaustive pattern-match warnings (#8779)

  * Change the implementations of `maximumBy` and `minimumBy` from
    `Data.Foldable` to use `foldl1` instead of `foldr1`. This makes them run
    in constant space when applied to lists. (#10830)

  * `mkFunTy`, `mkAppTy`, and `mkTyConApp` from `Data.Typeable` no longer exist.
    This functionality is superceded by the interfaces provided by
    `Type.Reflection`.

  * `mkTyCon3` is no longer exported by `Data.Typeable`. This function is
    replaced by `Type.Reflection.Unsafe.mkTyCon`.

  * `Data.List.NonEmpty.unfold` has been deprecated in favor of `unfoldr`,
    which is functionally equivalent.

## 4.9.0.0  *May 2016*

  * Bundled with GHC 8.0

  * `error` and `undefined` now print a partial stack-trace alongside the error message.

  * New `errorWithoutStackTrace` function throws an error without printing the stack trace.

  * The restore operation provided by `mask` and `uninterruptibleMask` now
    restores the previous masking state whatever the current masking state is.

  * New `GHC.Generics.packageName` operation

  * Redesigned `GHC.Stack.CallStack` data type. As a result, `CallStack`'s
    `Show` instance produces different output, and `CallStack` no longer has an
    `Eq` instance.

  * New `GHC.Generics.packageName` operation

  * New `GHC.Stack.Types` module now contains the definition of
    `CallStack` and `SrcLoc`

  * New `GHC.Stack.Types.emptyCallStack` function builds an empty `CallStack`

  * New `GHC.Stack.Types.freezeCallStack` function freezes a `CallStack` preventing future `pushCallStack` operations from having any effect

  * New `GHC.Stack.Types.pushCallStack` function pushes a call-site onto a `CallStack`

  * New `GHC.Stack.Types.fromCallSiteList` function creates a `CallStack` from
    a list of call-sites (i.e., `[(String, SrcLoc)]`)

  * `GHC.SrcLoc` has been removed

  * `GHC.Stack.showCallStack` and `GHC.SrcLoc.showSrcLoc` are now called
    `GHC.Stack.prettyCallStack` and `GHC.Stack.prettySrcLoc` respectively

  * add `Data.List.NonEmpty` and `Data.Semigroup` (to become
    super-class of `Monoid` in the future). These modules were
    provided by the `semigroups` package previously. (#10365)

  * Add `selSourceUnpackedness`, `selSourceStrictness`, and
    `selDecidedStrictness`, three functions which look up strictness
    information of a field in a data constructor, to the `Selector` type class
    in `GHC.Generics` (#10716)

  * Add `URec`, `UAddr`, `UChar`, `UDouble`, `UFloat`, `UInt`, and `UWord` to
    `GHC.Generics` as part of making GHC generics capable of handling
    unlifted types (#10868)

  * The `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read`, and `Show` instances for `U1` now use lazier
    pattern-matching

  * Keep `shift{L,R}` on `Integer` with negative shift-arguments from
    segfaulting (#10571)

  * Add `forkOSWithUnmask` to `Control.Concurrent`, which is like
    `forkIOWithUnmask`, but the child is run in a bound thread.

  * The `MINIMAL` definition of `Arrow` is now `arr AND (first OR (***))`.

  * The `MINIMAL` definition of `ArrowChoice` is now `left OR (+++)`.

  * Exported `GiveGCStats`, `DoCostCentres`, `DoHeapProfile`, `DoTrace`,
    `RtsTime`, and `RtsNat` from `GHC.RTS.Flags`

  * New function `GHC.IO.interruptible` used to correctly implement
    `Control.Exception.allowInterrupt` (#9516)

  * Made `PatternMatchFail`, `RecSelError`, `RecConError`, `RecUpdError`,
    `NoMethodError`, and `AssertionFailed` newtypes (#10738)

  * New module `Control.Monad.IO.Class` (previously provided by `transformers`
    package). (#10773)

  * New modules `Data.Functor.Classes`, `Data.Functor.Compose`,
    `Data.Functor.Product`, and `Data.Functor.Sum` (previously provided by
    `transformers` package). (#11135)

  * New instances for `Proxy`: `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Show1`, `Read1`. All
    of the classes are from `Data.Functor.Classes` (#11756).

  * New module `Control.Monad.Fail` providing new `MonadFail(fail)`
    class (#10751)

  * Add `GHC.TypeLits.TypeError` and `ErrorMessage` to allow users
    to define custom compile-time error messages.

  * Redesign `GHC.Generics` to use type-level literals to represent the
    metadata of generic representation types (#9766)

  * The `IsString` instance for `[Char]` has been modified to eliminate
    ambiguity arising from overloaded strings and functions like `(++)`.

  * Move `Const` from `Control.Applicative` to its own module in
   `Data.Functor.Const`. (#11135)

  * Re-export `Const` from `Control.Applicative` for backwards compatibility.

  * Expand `Floating` class to include operations that allow for better
    precision: `log1p`, `expm1`, `log1pexp` and `log1mexp`. These are not
    available from `Prelude`, but the full class is exported from `Numeric`.

  * New `Control.Exception.TypeError` datatype, which is thrown when an
    expression fails to typecheck when run using `-fdefer-type-errors` (#10284)

### New instances

  * `Alt`, `Dual`, `First`, `Last`, `Product`, and `Sum` now have `Data`,
    `MonadZip`, and `MonadFix` instances

  * The datatypes in `GHC.Generics` now have `Enum`, `Bounded`, `Ix`,
    `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, `MonadFix`, `MonadPlus`, `MonadZip`,

     - **TODO**

  * Generalise `forever` from `Monad` to `Applicative`

  * Enable `PolyKinds` in the `Data.Functor.Const` module to give `Const`
    the kind `* -> k -> *`. (#10039)


## 4.8.2.0  *Oct 2015*

  * Bundled with GHC 7.10.3

  * The restore operation provided by `mask` and `uninterruptibleMask` now
    restores the previous masking state whatever the current masking state is.

  * Weaken RealFloat constraints on some `Data.Complex` functions

  * Add `Control.Monad.(<$!>)` as a strict version of `(<$>)`

    are swapped, such that `Data.List.nubBy (<) [1,2]` now returns `[1]`
    instead of `[1,2]` (#2528, #3280, #7913)

  * New module `Data.Functor.Identity` (previously provided by `transformers`
    package). (#9664)

        enableAllocationLimit :: IO ()
        getAllocationCounter :: IO Int64
        setAllocationCounter :: Int64 -> IO ()

    together with a new exception `AllocationLimitExceeded`.

  * Make `read . show = id` for `Data.Fixed` (#9240)

    denoting the package version, when the given entity was introduced
    (or its type signature changed in a non-compatible way)

  * The `Control.Category` module now has the `PolyKinds` extension
    enabled, meaning that instances of `Category` no longer need be of
    kind `* -> * -> *`.

  * There are now `Foldable` and `Traversable` instances for `Either a`,
   `Const r`, and `(,) a`.

  * There are now `Show`, `Read`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Monoid`, `Generic`, and
    `Generic1` instances for `Const`.

  * There is now a `Data` instance for `Data.Version`.

  * A new `Data.Bits.FiniteBits` class has been added to represent
    types with fixed bit-count. The existing `Bits` class is extended
    with a `bitSizeMaybe` method to replace the now obsolete
    `bitsize` method.

  * `Data.Bits.Bits` gained a new `zeroBits` method which completes the
    `Bits` API with a direct way to introduce a value with all bits cleared.

  * There are now `Bits` and `FiniteBits` instances for `Bool`.

  * There are now `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Read`, `Generic`. and `Generic1`
    instances for `ZipList`.

  * There are now `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show` and `Read` instances for `Down`.

  * There are now `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Read` and `Generic` instances
    for types in GHC.Generics (`U1`, `Par1`, `Rec1`, `K1`, `M1`,
    `(:+:)`, `(:*:)`, `(:.:)`).

  * `Data.Monoid`: There are now `Generic` instances for `Dual`, `Endo`,
    `All`, `Any`, `Sum`, `Product`, `First`, and `Last`; as well as
    `Generic1` instances for `Dual`, `Sum`, `Product`, `First`, and `Last`.

  * The `Data.Monoid.{Product,Sum}` newtype wrappers now have `Num` instances.

  * There are now `Functor` instances for `System.Console.GetOpt`'s
    `ArgOrder`, `OptDescr`, and `ArgDescr`.

  * A zero-width unboxed poly-kinded `Proxy#` was added to
    `GHC.Prim`. It can be used to make it so that there is no the
    operational overhead for passing around proxy arguments to model
    type application.

  * New `Data.Proxy` module providing a concrete, poly-kinded proxy type.

  * New `Data.Coerce` module which exports the new `Coercible` class
    together with the `coerce` primitive which provide safe coercion
    (wrt role checking) between types with same representation.

  * `Control.Concurrent.MVar` has a new implementation of `readMVar`,
    which fixes a long-standing bug where `readMVar` is only atomic if
    there are no other threads running `putMVar`.  `readMVar` now is
    atomic, and is guaranteed to return the value from the first
    `putMVar`.  There is also a new `tryReadMVar` which is a
    non-blocking version.

  * New `Control.Concurrent.MVar.withMVarMasked` which executes
    `IO` action with asynchronous exceptions masked in the same style
    as the existing `modifyMVarMasked` and `modifyMVarMasked_`.

  * New `threadWait{Read,Write}STM :: Fd -> IO (STM (), IO ())`
    functions added to `Control.Concurrent` for waiting on FD
    readiness with STM actions.

  * Expose `Data.Fixed.Fixed`'s constructor.

  * There are now byte endian-swapping primitives
    `byteSwap{16,32,64}` available in `Data.Word`, which use
    optimized machine instructions when available.

  * `Data.Bool` now exports `bool :: a -> a -> Bool -> a`, analogously
    to `maybe` and `either` in their respective modules.

  * `Data.Either` now exports `isLeft, isRight :: Either a b -> Bool`.

  * `Debug.Trace` now exports `traceId`, `traceShowId`, `traceM`,
    and `traceShowM`.

  * `Data.Functor` now exports `($>)` and `void`.

  * Rewrote portions of `Text.Printf`, and made changes to `Numeric`
    (added `Numeric.showFFloatAlt` and `Numeric.showGFloatAlt`) and
    `GHC.Float` (added `formatRealFloatAlt`) to support it.  The
    rewritten version is extensible to user types, adds a "generic"
    format specifier "`%v`", extends the `printf` spec to support much
    of C's `printf(3)` functionality, and fixes the spurious warnings
    about using `Text.Printf.printf` at `(IO a)` while ignoring the
    return value.  These changes were contributed by Bart Massey.

  * The minimal complete definitions for all type-classes with cyclic
    default implementations have been explicitly annotated with the
    new `{-# MINIMAL #-}` pragma.

  * `Control.Applicative.WrappedMonad`, which can be used to convert a
    `Monad` to an `Applicative`, has now a
    `Monad m => Monad (WrappedMonad m)` instance.

  * There is now a `Generic` and a `Generic1` instance for `WrappedMonad`
    and `WrappedArrow`.

  * Handle `ExitFailure (-sig)` on Unix by killing process with signal `sig`.

  * New module `Data.Type.Bool` providing operations on type-level booleans.

  * Expose `System.Mem.performMinorGC` for triggering minor GCs.

  * New `System.Environment.{set,unset}Env` for manipulating
    environment variables.

  * Add `Typeable` instance for `(->)` and `RealWorld`.

  * Declare CPP header `<Typeable.h>` officially obsolete as GHC 7.8+
    does not support hand-written `Typeable` instances anymore.

  * Remove (unmaintained) Hugs98 and NHC98 specific code.

  * Optimize `System.Timeout.timeout` for the threaded RTS.

  * Remove deprecated functions `unsafeInterleaveST`, `unsafeIOToST`,
    and `unsafeSTToIO` from `Control.Monad.ST`.

  * Add a new superclass `SomeAsyncException` for all asynchronous exceptions
    and makes the existing `AsyncException` and `Timeout` exception children
    of `SomeAsyncException` in the hierarchy.

  * Remove deprecated functions `blocked`, `unblock`, and `block` from
    `Control.Exception`.

  * Remove deprecated function `forkIOUnmasked` from `Control.Concurrent`.

  * Remove deprecated function `unsafePerformIO` export from `Foreign`
    (still available via `System.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO`).

  * Various fixes and other improvements (see Git history for full details).
