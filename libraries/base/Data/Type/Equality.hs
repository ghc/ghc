type (==) :: k -> k -> Bool
type family a == b where

  a == a = 'True
  _ == _ = 'False

-- The idea here is to recognize equality of *applications* using
-- the first case, and of *constructors* using the second and third
-- ones. It would be wonderful if GHC recognized that the
-- first and second cases are compatible, which would allow us to
-- prove
--
-- a ~ b => a == b
--
-- but it (understandably) does not.
--
-- It is absolutely critical that the three cases occur in precisely
-- this order. In particular, if
--
-- a == a = 'True
--
-- came first, then the type application case would only be reached
-- (uselessly) when GHC discovered that the types were not equal.
--
-- One might reasonably ask what's wrong with a simpler version:
--
-- type family (a :: k) == (b :: k) where
--  a == a = True
--  a == b = False
--
-- Consider
-- data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
--
-- Suppose I want
-- foo :: (Succ n == Succ m) ~ True => ((n == m) :~: True)
-- foo = Refl
--
-- This would not type-check with the simple version. `Succ n == Succ m`
-- is stuck. We don't know enough about `n` and `m` to reduce the family.
-- With the recursive version, `Succ n == Succ m` reduces to
-- `Succ == Succ && n == m`, which can reduce to `'True && n == m` and
-- finally to `n == m`.
