-- "Lorem, ipsum, dolor"
intercalate :: [a] -> [[a]] -> [a]

GHC's mergesort replaced by a better implementation, 24/12/2009.
This code originally contributed to the nhc12 compiler by Thomas Nordin
in 2002.  Rumoured to have been based on code by Lennart Augustsson, e.g.
    http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell@haskell.org/msg01822.html
and possibly to bear similarities to a 1982 paper by Richard O'Keefe:
"A smooth applicative merge sort".

Benchmarks show it to be often 2x the speed of the previous implementation.

Quicksort replaced by mergesort, 14/5/2002.

From: Ian Lynagh <igloo@earth.li>

I am curious as to why the List.sort implementation in GHC is a
quicksort algorithm rather than an algorithm that guarantees n log n
time in the worst case? I have attached a mergesort implementation along
with a few scripts to time it's performance, the results of which are
shown below (* means it didn't finish successfully - in all cases this
was due to a stack overflow).

If I heap profile the random_list case with only 10000 then I see
random_list peaks at using about 2.5M of memory, whereas in the same
program using List.sort it uses only 100k.

-- | The 'unfoldr' function is a \`dual\' to 'foldr': while 'foldr'
-- reduces a list to a summary value, 'unfoldr' builds a list from
-- a seed value.  The function takes the element and returns 'Nothing'
-- if it is done producing the list or returns 'Just' @(a,b)@, in which
-- case, @a@ is a prepended to the list and @b@ is used as the next
-- element in a recursive call.  For example,
--
-- > iterate f == unfoldr (\x -> Just (x, f x))
--
-- In some cases, 'unfoldr' can undo a 'foldr' operation:
--
-- > unfoldr f' (foldr f z xs) == xs
--
-- if the following holds:
--
-- > f' (f x y) = Just (x,y)
-- > f' z       = Nothing
--

--
-- >>> unfoldr (\b -> if b == 0 then Nothing else Just (b, b-1)) 10
-- [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
--

-- Note [INLINE unfoldr]
-- We treat unfoldr a little differently from some other forms for list fusion
-- for two reasons:
--
-- 1. We don't want to use a rule to rewrite a basic form to a fusible
-- form because this would inline before constant floating. As Simon Peyton-
-- Jones and others have pointed out, this could reduce sharing in some cases
-- where sharing is beneficial. Thus we simply INLINE it, which is, for
-- example, how enumFromTo::Int becomes eftInt. Unfortunately, we don't seem
-- to get enough of an inlining discount to get a version of eftInt based on
-- unfoldr to inline as readily as the usual one. We know that all the Maybe
-- nonsense will go away, but the compiler does not.
--
-- 2. The benefit of inlining unfoldr is likely to be huge in many common cases,
-- even apart from list fusion. In particular, inlining unfoldr often
-- allows GHC to erase all the Maybes. This appears to be critical if unfoldr
-- is to be used in high-performance code. A small increase in code size
-- in the relatively rare cases when this does not happen looks like a very
-- small price to pay.
--
-- Doing a back-and-forth dance doesn't seem to accomplish anything if the
-- final form has to be inlined in any case.

{- A "SnocBuilder" is a version of Chris Okasaki's banker's queue that supports
toListSB instead of uncons. In single-threaded use, its performance
characteristics are similar to John Hughes's functional difference lists, but
likely somewhat worse. In heavily persistent settings, however, it does much
better, because it takes advantage of sharing. The banker's queue guarantees
(amortized) O(1) snoc and O(1) uncons, meaning that we can think of toListSB as
an O(1) conversion to a list-like structure a constant factor slower than
normal lists--we pay the O(n) cost incrementally as we consume the list. Using
functional difference lists, on the other hand, we would have to pay the whole
cost up front for each output list. -}

{- We store a front list, a rear list, and the length of the queue.  Because we
only snoc onto the queue and never uncons, we know it's time to rotate when the
length of the queue plus 1 is a power of 2. Note that we rely on the value of
the length field only for performance.  In the unlikely event of overflow, the
performance will suffer but the semantics will remain correct.  -}
