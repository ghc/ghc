    Handle,             -- abstract, instance of: Eq, Show.

    -- | GHC note: a 'Handle' will be automatically closed when the garbage
    -- collector detects that it has become unreferenced by the program.
    -- However, relying on this behaviour is not generally recommended:
    -- the garbage collector is unpredictable.  If possible, use
    -- an explicit 'hClose' to close 'Handle's when they are no longer
    -- required.  GHC does not currently attempt to free up file
    -- descriptors when they have run out, it is your responsibility to
    -- ensure that this doesn't happen.

    -- ** Standard handles

    -- | Three handles are allocated during program initialisation,
    -- and are initially open.

    -- | A text-mode 'Handle' has an associated 'TextEncoding', which
    -- is used to decode bytes into Unicode characters when reading,
    -- and encode Unicode characters into bytes when writing.
    --
    -- The default 'TextEncoding' is the same as the default encoding
    -- on your system, which is also available as 'localeEncoding'.
    -- (GHC note: on Windows, we currently do not support double-byte
    -- encodings; if the console\'s code page is unsupported, then
    -- 'localeEncoding' will be 'latin1'.)
    --
    -- Encoding and decoding errors are always detected and reported,
    -- except during lazy I/O ('hGetContents', 'getContents', and
    -- 'readFile'), where a decoding error merely results in
    -- termination of the character stream, as with other I/O errors.

    -- * Newline conversion

    -- | In Haskell, a newline is always represented by the character
    -- '\n'.  However, in files and external character streams, a
    -- newline may be represented by another character sequence, such
    -- as '\r\n'.
    --
    -- A text-mode 'Handle' has an associated 'NewlineMode' that
    -- specifies how to transate newline characters.  The
    -- 'NewlineMode' specifies the input and output translation
    -- separately, so that for instance you can translate '\r\n'
    -- to '\n' on input, but leave newlines as '\n' on output.
    --
    -- The default 'NewlineMode' for a 'Handle' is
    -- 'nativeNewlineMode', which does no translation on Unix systems,
    -- but translates '\r\n' to '\n' and back on Windows.
    --
    -- Binary-mode 'Handle's do no newline translation at all.

-- | The 'print' function outputs a value of any printable type to the
-- standard output device.
-- Printable types are those that are instances of class 'Show'; 'print'
-- converts values to strings for output using the 'show' operation and
-- adds a newline.
--
-- For example, a program to print the first 20 integers and their
-- powers of 2 could be written as:
--

-- which is read lazily as it is needed
-- (same as 'hGetContents' 'stdin').

-- | The 'interact' function takes a function of type @String->String@

-- NOTE: we do our own explicit black holing here, because GHC's lazy
-- blackholing isn't enough.  In an infinite loop, GHC may run the IO
-- computation a few times before it notices the loop, which is wrong.
--
-- NOTE2: the explicit black-holing with an IORef ran into trouble
-- with multiple threads (see #5421), so now we use an MVar.  I'm
-- actually wondering whether we should use readMVar rather than
-- takeMVar, just in case it ends up being executed multiple times,
-- but even then it would have to be masked to protect against async
-- exceptions.  Ugh.  What we really need here is an IVar, or an
-- atomic readMVar, or even STM.  All these seem like overkill.

-- rely on this behaviour it is best to use local filesystems only.

-- $locking
-- Implementations should enforce as far as possible, at least locally to the
-- Haskell process, multiple-reader single-writer locking on files.
-- That is, /there may either be many handles on the same file which manage input, or just one handle on the file which manages output/.  If any
-- open or semi-closed handle is managing a file for output, no new
-- handle can be allocated for that file.  If any open or semi-closed
-- handle is managing a file for input, new handles can only be allocated
-- if they do not manage output.  Whether two files are the same is
-- implementation-dependent, but they should normally be the same if they
-- have the same absolute path name and neither has been renamed, for
-- example.
--
-- /Warning/: the 'readFile' operation holds a semi-closed handle on
-- the file until the entire contents of the file have been consumed.
-- It follows that an attempt to write to a file (using 'writeFile', for
-- example) that was earlier opened by 'readFile' will usually result in
-- failure with 'System.IO.Error.isAlreadyInUseError'.
