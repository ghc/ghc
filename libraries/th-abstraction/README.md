[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/th-abstraction.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-abstraction) [![Build Status](https://github.com/glguy/th-abstraction/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/glguy/th-abstraction/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

This package provides a consistent interface to a subset of Template Haskell.

Currently the package provides a consistent view of the reified declaration
information about datatypes, newtypes, and data family instances. These
interfaces abstract away the differences in the normal and GADT syntax used to
define these types.
