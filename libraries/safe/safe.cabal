description:
    A library wrapping @Prelude@/@Data.List@ functions that can throw exceptions, such as @head@ and @!!@.
    Each unsafe function has up to four variants, e.g. with @tail@:
    .
    * @tail :: [a] -> [a]@, raises an error on @tail []@.
    .
    * @tailMay :: [a] -> /Maybe/ [a]@, turns errors into @Nothing@.
    .
    * @tailDef :: /[a]/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes a default to return on errors.
    .
    * @tailNote :: /String/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes an extra argument which supplements the error message.
    .
    * @tailSafe :: [a] -> [a]@, returns some sensible default if possible, @[]@ in the case of @tail@.
    .
    This package is divided into three modules:
    .
    * "Safe" contains safe variants of @Prelude@ and @Data.List@ functions.
    .
    * "Safe.Foldable" contains safe variants of @Foldable@ functions.
    .
    * "Safe.Exact" creates crashing versions of functions like @zip@ (errors if the lists are not equal) and @take@ (errors if there are not enough elements), then wraps them to provide safe variants.
