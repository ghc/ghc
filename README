The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
============================

This is the source tree for GHC, a compiler and interactive
environment for the Haskell functional programming language.

For more information, visit GHC's web site:

  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Information for developers of GHC can be found here:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/


Getting the Source
==================

First get the GHC darcs repository:

   $ darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc/

Then run the darcs-all shell script in that repository 
to get the other repositories:

   $ cd ghc
   $ sh darcs-all

This grabs the "core" packages by default.  To get the full set of
packages (which will probably take a long time to build), instead say

   $ sh darcs-all --extra get


Building & Installing
=====================

NB. you need GHC installed in order to build GHC, because the compiler
is itself written in Haskell.  It is possible to build GHC using just
a C compiler, but we don't recommend this as the normal route.  If you
*really* want to do it this way, then see the Building Guide (link
below).

You also need a few other tools installed: Happy [4], Alex [5], and
Haddock [6] (for building library documentation), and a good DocBook
XML toolchain if you want to build the compiler documentation. 

Quick start:  the following gives you a default build:

	$ autoreconf
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

The autoreconf step is only necessary if this is a tree checked out
from darcs.  For source distributions downloaded from GHC's web site,
this step has already been performed.

These steps give you the default build, which includes everything
optimised and built in various ways (eg. profiling libs are built).
It can take a long time.  To customise the build, see the file
HACKING.

For full information on building GHC, see the GHC Building Guide [3],
which is also available in source form (DocBook XML) in docs/building.
