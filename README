This is the root directory for functional-programming tools
distributed by the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University.
Simon Peyton Jones <simonpj@dcs.gla.ac.uk> is the ringleader of this
effort.  The tools are:

    ghc		the Glasgow Haskell compilation system
    hslibs	collection of Haskell libraries
    haggis	the Haggis GUI toolkit
    happy	the Happy Haskell parser generator
    nofib	the NoFib Haskell benchmarking suite
    literate	the Glasgow "literate programming" system
    glafp-utils shared utility programs
    mk	        GNU make setup used by all the fptools
    docs        documentation on the installing and using
                the fptools suite.

The "literate" stuff is usually distributed *with* other systems, but
not necessarily.  Components which are always part of a distribution
(never stand-alone) are "glafp-utils" and "mk" (a configuration
system).

There is usually an ANNOUNCE* file with any distribution.  Please
consult that, or the <piece>/README file, to find out how to proceed.
