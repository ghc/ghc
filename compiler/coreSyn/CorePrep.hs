-- Note [CorePrep Overview]
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this pass is to prepare for code generation.

1.  Saturate constructor applications.

2.  Convert to A-normal form; that is, function arguments
    are always variables.

    * Use case for strict arguments:
        f E ==> case E of x -> f x
        (where f is strict)

    * Use let for non-trivial lazy arguments
        f E ==> let x = E in f x
        (were f is lazy and x is non-trivial)

3.  Similarly, convert any unboxed lets into cases.
    [I'm experimenting with leaving 'ok-for-speculation'
     rhss in let-form right up to this point.]

4.  Ensure that *value* lambdas only occur as the RHS of a binding
    (The code generator can't deal with anything else.)
    Type lambdas are ok, however, because the code gen discards them.

5.  [Not any more; nuked Jun 2002] Do the seq/par munging.

6.  Clone all local Ids.
    This means that all such Ids are unique, rather than the
    weaker guarantee of no clashes which the simplifier provides.
    And that is what the code generator needs.

    We don't clone TyVars or CoVars. The code gen doesn't need that,
    and doing so would be tiresome because then we'd need
    to substitute in types and coercions.

7.  Give each dynamic CCall occurrence a fresh unique; this is
    rather like the cloning step above.

8.  Inject bindings for the "implicit" Ids:
        * Constructor wrappers
        * Constructor workers
    We want curried definitions for all of these in case they
    aren't inlined by some caller.

9.  Replace (lazy e) by e.  See Note [lazyId magic] in MkId.hs
    Also replace (noinline e) by e.

10. Convert (LitInteger i t) into the core representation
    for the Integer i. Normally this uses mkInteger, but if
    we are using the integer-gmp implementation then there is a
    special case where we use the S# constructor for Integers that
    are in the range of Int.

11. Same for LitNatural.

12. Uphold tick consistency while doing this: We move ticks out of
    (non-type) applications where we can, and make sure that we
    annotate according to scoping rules when floating.

13. Collect cost centres (including cost centres in unfoldings) if we're in
    profiling mode. We have to do this here beucase we won't have unfoldings
    after this pass (see `zapUnfolding` and Note [Drop unfoldings and rules].

This is all done modulo type applications and abstractions, so that
when type erasure is done for conversion to STG, we don't end up with
any trivial or useless bindings.


Note [CorePrep invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is the syntax of the Core produced by CorePrep:

    Trivial expressions
       arg ::= lit |  var
              | arg ty  |  /\a. arg
              | truv co  |  /\c. arg  |  arg |> co

    Applications
       app ::= lit  |  var  |  app arg  |  app ty  | app co | app |> co

    Expressions
       body ::= app
              | let(rec) x = rhs in body     -- Boxed only
              | case body of pat -> body
              | /\a. body | /\c. body
              | body |> co

    Right hand sides (only place where value lambdas can occur)
       rhs ::= /\a.rhs  |  \x.rhs  |  body

We define a synonym for each of these non-terminals.  Functions
with the corresponding name produce a result in that syntax.

Note [Floating out of top level bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NB: we do need to float out of top-level bindings
Consider        x = length [True,False]
We want to get
                s1 = False : []
                s2 = True  : s1
                x  = length s2

We return a *list* of bindings, because we may start with
        x* = f (g y)
where x is demanded, in which case we want to finish with
        a = g y
        x* = f a
And then x will actually end up case-bound

Note [CafInfo and floating]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What happens when we try to float bindings to the top level?  At this
point all the CafInfo is supposed to be correct, and we must make certain
that is true of the new top-level bindings.  There are two cases
to consider

a) The top-level binding is marked asCafRefs.  In that case we are
   basically fine.  The floated bindings had better all be lazy lets,
   so they can float to top level, but they'll all have HasCafRefs
   (the default) which is safe.

b) The top-level binding is marked NoCafRefs.  This really happens
   Example.  CoreTidy produces
      $fApplicativeSTM [NoCafRefs] = D:Alternative retry# ...blah...
   Now CorePrep has to eta-expand to
      $fApplicativeSTM = let sat = \xy. retry x y
                         in D:Alternative sat ...blah...
   So what we *want* is
      sat [NoCafRefs] = \xy. retry x y
      $fApplicativeSTM [NoCafRefs] = D:Alternative sat ...blah...

   So, gruesomely, we must set the NoCafRefs flag on the sat bindings,
   *and* substitute the modified 'sat' into the old RHS.

   It should be the case that 'sat' is itself [NoCafRefs] (a value, no
   cafs) else the original top-level binding would not itself have been
   marked [NoCafRefs].  The DEBUG check in CoreToStg for
   consistentCafInfo will find this.

This is all very gruesome and horrible. It would be better to figure
out CafInfo later, after CorePrep.  We'll do that in due course.
Meanwhile this horrible hack works.

Note [Join points and floating]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Join points can float out of other join points but not out of value bindings:

  let z =
    let  w = ... in -- can float
    join k = ... in -- can't float
    ... jump k ...
  join j x1 ... xn =
    let  y = ... in -- can float (but don't want to)
    join h = ... in -- can float (but not much point)
    ... jump h ...
  in ...

Here, the jump to h remains valid if h is floated outward, but the jump to k
does not.

We don't float *out* of join points. It would only be safe to float out of
nullary join points (or ones where the arguments are all either type arguments
or dead binders). Nullary join points aren't ever recursive, so they're always
effectively one-shot functions, which we don't float out of. We *could* float
join points from nullary join points, but there's no clear benefit at this
stage.

Note [Data constructor workers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create any necessary "implicit" bindings for data con workers.  We
create the rather strange (non-recursive!) binding

        $wC = \x y -> $wC x y

i.e. a curried constructor that allocates.  This means that we can
treat the worker for a constructor like any other function in the rest
of the compiler.  The point here is that CoreToStg will generate a
StgConApp for the RHS, rather than a call to the worker (which would
give a loop).  As Lennart says: the ice is thin here, but it works.

Hmm.  Should we create bindings for dictionary constructors?  They are
always fully applied, and the bindings are just there to support
partial applications. But it's easier to let them through.


Note [Dead code in CorePrep]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine that we got an input program like this (see Trac #4962):

  f :: Show b => Int -> (Int, b -> Maybe Int -> Int)
  f x = (g True (Just x) + g () (Just x), g)
    where
      g :: Show a => a -> Maybe Int -> Int
      g _ Nothing = x
      g y (Just z) = if z > 100 then g y (Just (z + length (show y))) else g y unknown

After specialisation and SpecConstr, we would get something like this:

  f :: Show b => Int -> (Int, b -> Maybe Int -> Int)
  f x = (g$Bool_True_Just x + g$Unit_Unit_Just x, g)
    where
      {-# RULES g $dBool = g$Bool
                g $dUnit = g$Unit #-}
      g = ...
      {-# RULES forall x. g$Bool True (Just x) = g$Bool_True_Just x #-}
      g$Bool = ...
      {-# RULES forall x. g$Unit () (Just x) = g$Unit_Unit_Just x #-}
      g$Unit = ...
      g$Bool_True_Just = ...
      g$Unit_Unit_Just = ...

Note that the g$Bool and g$Unit functions are actually dead code: they
are only kept alive by the occurrence analyser because they are
referred to by the rules of g, which is being kept alive by the fact
that it is used (unspecialised) in the returned pair.

However, at the CorePrep stage there is no way that the rules for g
will ever fire, and it really seems like a shame to produce an output
program that goes to the trouble of allocating a closure for the
unreachable g$Bool and g$Unit functions.

The way we fix this is to:
 * In cloneBndr, drop all unfoldings/rules

 * In deFloatTop, run a simple dead code analyser on each top-level
   RHS to drop the dead local bindings. For that call to OccAnal, we
   disable the binder swap, else the occurrence analyser sometimes
   introduces new let bindings for cased binders, which lead to the bug
   in #5433.

The reason we don't just OccAnal the whole output of CorePrep is that
the tidier ensures that all top-level binders are GlobalIds, so they
don't show up in the free variables any longer. So if you run the
occurrence analyser on the output of CoreTidy (or later) you e.g. turn
this program:

  Rec {
  f = ... f ...
  }

Into this one:

  f = ... f ...

(Since f is not considered to be free in its own RHS.)

{- Note [Silly extra arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we had this
        f{arity=1} = \x\y. e
We *must* match the arity on the Id, so we have to generate
        f' = \x\y. e
        f  = \x. f' x

It's a bizarre case: why is the arity on the Id wrong?  Reason

Note [Arity and join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Up to now, we've allowed a join point to have an arity greater than its join
arity (minus type arguments), since this is what's useful for eta expansion.
However, for code gen purposes, its arity must be exactly the number of value
arguments it will be called with, and it must have exactly that many value
lambdas. Hence if there are extra lambdas we must let-bind the body of the RHS:

  join j x y z = \w -> ... in ...
    =>
  join j x y z = (let f = \w -> ... in f) in ...

This is also what happens with Note [Silly extra arguments]. Note that it's okay
for us to mess with the arity because a join point is never exported.

{- Note [runRW magic]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some definitions, for instance @runST@, must have careful control over float out
of the bindings in their body. Consider this use of @runST@,

    f x = runST ( \ s -> let (a, s')  = newArray# 100 [] s
                             (_, s'') = fill_in_array_or_something a x s'
                         in freezeArray# a s'' )

If we inline @runST@, we'll get:

    f x = let (a, s')  = newArray# 100 [] realWorld#{-NB-}
              (_, s'') = fill_in_array_or_something a x s'
          in freezeArray# a s''

And now if we allow the @newArray#@ binding to float out to become a CAF,
we end up with a result that is totally and utterly wrong:

    f = let (a, s')  = newArray# 100 [] realWorld#{-NB-} -- YIKES!!!
        in \ x ->
            let (_, s'') = fill_in_array_or_something a x s'
            in freezeArray# a s''

All calls to @f@ will share a {\em single} array! Clearly this is nonsense and
must be prevented.

This is what @runRW#@ gives us: by being inlined extremely late in the
optimization (right before lowering to STG, in CorePrep), we can ensure that
no further floating will occur. This allows us to safely inline things like
@runST@, which are otherwise needlessly expensive (see #10678 and #5916).

'runRW' is defined (for historical reasons) in GHC.Magic, with a NOINLINE
pragma.  It is levity-polymorphic.

    runRW# :: forall (r1 :: RuntimeRep). (o :: TYPE r)
           => (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, o #))
                              -> (# State# RealWorld, o #)

It needs no special treatment in GHC except this special inlining here
in CorePrep (and in ByteCodeGen).

Note [ANF-ising literal string arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a program like,

    data Foo = Foo Addr#

    foo = Foo "turtle"#

When we go to ANFise this we might think that we want to float the string
literal like we do any other non-trivial argument. This would look like,

    foo = u\ [] case "turtle"# of s { __DEFAULT__ -> Foo s }

However, this 1) isn't necessary since strings are in a sense "trivial"; and 2)
wreaks havoc on the CAF annotations that we produce here since we the result
above is caffy since it is updateable. Ideally at some point in the future we
would like to just float the literal to the top level as suggested in #11312,

    s = "turtle"#
    foo = Foo s

However, until then we simply add a special case excluding literals from the
floating done by cpeArg.

Note [Floating unlifted arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider    C (let v* = expensive in v)

where the "*" indicates "will be demanded".  Usually v will have been
inlined by now, but let's suppose it hasn't (see Trac #2756).  Then we
do *not* want to get

     let v* = expensive in C v

because that has different strictness.  Hence the use of 'allLazy'.
(NB: the let v* turns into a FloatCase, in mkLocalNonRec.)

Note [Eta expansion of hasNoBinding things in CorePrep]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
maybeSaturate deals with eta expanding to saturate things that can't deal with
unsaturated applications (identified by 'hasNoBinding', currently just
foreign calls and unboxed tuple/sum constructors).

Note that eta expansion in CorePrep is very fragile due to the "prediction" of
CAFfyness made by TidyPgm (see Note [CAFfyness inconsistencies due to eta
expansion in CorePrep] in TidyPgm for details.  We previously saturated primop
applications here as well but due to this fragility (see #16846) we now deal
with this another way, as described in Note [Primop wrappers] in PrimOp.

It's quite likely that eta expansion of constructor applications will
eventually break in a similar way to how primops did. We really should
eliminate this case as well.

--      Eta reduction
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note [Eta expansion]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Eta expand to match the arity claimed by the binder Remember,
CorePrep must not change arity

Eta expansion might not have happened already, because it is done by
the simplifier only when there at least one lambda already.

NB1:we could refrain when the RHS is trivial (which can happen
    for exported things).  This would reduce the amount of code
    generated (a little) and make things a little words for
    code compiled without -O.  The case in point is data constructor
    wrappers.

NB2: we have to be careful that the result of etaExpand doesn't
   invalidate any of the assumptions that CorePrep is attempting
   to establish.  One possible cause is eta expanding inside of
   an SCC note - we're now careful in etaExpand to make sure the
   SCC is pushed inside any new lambdas that are generated.

Note [Eta expansion and the CorePrep invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It turns out to be much much easier to do eta expansion
*after* the main CorePrep stuff.  But that places constraints
on the eta expander: given a CpeRhs, it must return a CpeRhs.

For example here is what we do not want:
                f = /\a -> g (h 3)      -- h has arity 2
After ANFing we get
                f = /\a -> let s = h 3 in g s
and now we do NOT want eta expansion to give
                f = /\a -> \ y -> (let s = h 3 in g s) y

Instead CoreArity.etaExpand gives
                f = /\a -> \y -> let s = h 3 in g s y

Why try eta reduction?  Hasn't the simplifier already done eta?
But the simplifier only eta reduces if that leaves something
trivial (like f, or f Int).  But for deLam it would be enough to
get to a partial application:
        case x of { p -> \xs. map f xs }

-- Note [Inlining in CorePrep]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- There is a subtle but important invariant that must be upheld in the output
-- of CorePrep: there are no "trivial" updatable thunks.  Thus, this Core
-- is impermissible:
--
--      let x :: ()
--          x = y
--
-- (where y is a reference to a GLOBAL variable).  Thunks like this are silly:
-- they can always be profitably replaced by inlining x with y. Consequently,
-- the code generator/runtime does not bother implementing this properly
-- (specifically, there is no implementation of stg_ap_0_upd_info, which is the
-- stack frame that would be used to update this thunk.  The "0" means it has
-- zero free variables.)
--
-- In general, the inliner is good at eliminating these let-bindings.  However,
-- there is one case where these trivial updatable thunks can arise: when
-- we are optimizing away 'lazy' (see Note [lazyId magic], and also
-- 'cpeRhsE'.)  Then, we could have started with:
--
--      let x :: ()
--          x = lazy @ () y
--
-- which is a perfectly fine, non-trivial thunk, but then CorePrep will
-- drop 'lazy', giving us 'x = y' which is trivial and impermissible.
-- The solution is CorePrep to have a miniature inlining pass which deals
-- with cases like this.  We can then drop the let-binding altogether.
--
-- Why does the removal of 'lazy' have to occur in CorePrep?
-- The gory details are in Note [lazyId magic] in MkId, but the
-- main reason is that lazy must appear in unfoldings (optimizer
-- output) and it must prevent call-by-value for catch# (which
-- is implemented by CorePrep.)
--
-- An alternate strategy for solving this problem is to have the
-- inliner treat 'lazy e' as a trivial expression if 'e' is trivial.
-- We decided not to adopt this solution to keep the definition
-- of 'exprIsTrivial' simple.
--
-- There is ONE caveat however: for top-level bindings we have
-- to preserve the binding so that we float the (hacky) non-recursive
-- binding for data constructors; see Note [Data constructor workers].
--
-- Note [CorePrep inlines trivial CoreExpr not Id]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Why does cpe_env need to be an IdEnv CoreExpr, as opposed to an
-- IdEnv Id?  Naively, we might conjecture that trivial updatable thunks
-- as per Note [Inlining in CorePrep] always have the form
-- 'lazy @ SomeType gbl_id'.  But this is not true: the following is
-- perfectly reasonable Core:
--
--      let x :: ()
--          x = lazy @ (forall a. a) y @ Bool
--
-- When we inline 'x' after eliminating 'lazy', we need to replace
-- occurrences of 'x' with 'y @ bool', not just 'y'.  Situations like
-- this can easily arise with higher-rank types; thus, cpe_env must
-- map to CoreExprs, not Ids.

{- Note [Drop unfoldings and rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want to drop the unfolding/rules on every Id:

  - We are now past interface-file generation, and in the
    codegen pipeline, so we really don't need full unfoldings/rules

  - The unfolding/rule may be keeping stuff alive that we'd like
    to discard.  See  Note [Dead code in CorePrep]

  - Getting rid of unnecessary unfoldings reduces heap usage

  - We are changing uniques, so if we didn't discard unfoldings/rules
    we'd have to substitute in them

HOWEVER, we want to preserve evaluated-ness;
see Note [Preserve evaluatedness] in CoreTidy.

-- Floating ticks
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Note [Floating Ticks in CorePrep]
--
-- It might seem counter-intuitive to float ticks by default, given
-- that we don't actually want to move them if we can help it. On the
-- other hand, nothing gets very far in CorePrep anyway, and we want
-- to preserve the order of let bindings and tick annotations in
-- relation to each other. For example, if we just wrapped let floats
-- when they pass through ticks, we might end up performing the
-- following transformation:
--
--   src<...> let foo = bar in baz
--   ==>  let foo = src<...> bar in src<...> baz
--
-- Because the let-binding would float through the tick, and then
-- immediately materialize, achieving nothing but decreasing tick
-- accuracy. The only special case is the following scenario:
--
--   let foo = src<...> (let a = b in bar) in baz
--   ==>  let foo = src<...> bar; a = src<...> b in baz
--
-- Here we would not want the source tick to end up covering "baz" and
-- therefore refrain from pushing ticks outside. Instead, we copy them
-- into the floating binds (here "a") in cpePair. Note that where "b"
-- or "bar" are (value) lambdas we have to push the annotations
-- further inside in order to uphold our rules.
--
-- All of this is implemented below in @wrapTicks@.
