Version 3.0     28 May 1997
  * Cured massive performance bug.  If you write

        foldl <> empty (map (text.show) [1..10000])

    you get quadratic behaviour with V2.0.  Why?  For just the same reason as you get
    quadratic behaviour with left-associated (++) chains.

    This is really bad news.  One thing a pretty-printer abstraction should
    certainly guarantee is insensivity to associativity.  It matters: suddenly
    GHC's compilation times went up by a factor of 100 when I switched to the
    new pretty printer.
 
    I fixed it with a bit of a hack (because I wanted to get GHC back on the
    road).  I added two new constructors to the Doc type, Above and Beside:
 
         <> = Beside
         $$ = Above
 
    Then, where I need to get to a "TextBeside" or "NilAbove" form I "force"
    the Doc to squeeze out these suspended calls to Beside and Above; but in so
    doing I re-associate. It's quite simple, but I'm not satisfied that I've done
    the best possible job.  I'll send you the code if you are interested.

  * Added new exports:
        punctuate, hang
        int, integer, float, double, rational,
        lparen, rparen, lbrack, rbrack, lbrace, rbrace,

  * fullRender's type signature has changed.  Rather than producing a string it
    now takes an extra couple of arguments that tells it how to glue fragments
    of output together:

        fullRender :: Mode
                   -> Int                       -- Line length
                   -> Float                     -- Ribbons per line
                   -> (TextDetails -> a -> a)   -- What to do with text
                   -> a                         -- What to do at the end
                   -> Doc
                   -> a                         -- Result

    The "fragments" are encapsulated in the TextDetails data type:
        data TextDetails = Chr  Char
                         | Str  String
                         | PStr FastString

    The Chr and Str constructors are obvious enough.  The PStr constructor has a packed
    string (FastString) inside it.  It's generated by using the new "ptext" export.

    An advantage of this new setup is that you can get the renderer to do output
    directly (by passing in a function of type (TextDetails -> IO () -> IO ()),
    rather than producing a string that you then print.


Version 2.0     24 April 1997
  * Made empty into a left unit for <> as well as a right unit;
    it is also now true that
        nest k empty = empty
    which wasn't true before.

  * Fixed an obscure bug in sep that occassionally gave very wierd behaviour

  * Added $+$

  * Corrected and tidied up the laws and invariants

======================================================================
Relative to John's original paper, there are the following new features:

1.  There's an empty document, "empty".  It's a left and right unit for 
    both <> and $$, and anywhere in the argument list for
    sep, hcat, hsep, vcat, fcat etc.

    It is Really Useful in practice.

2.  There is a paragraph-fill combinator, fsep, that's much like sep,
    only it keeps fitting things on one line until itc can't fit any more.

3.  Some random useful extra combinators are provided.  
        <+> puts its arguments beside each other with a space between them,
            unless either argument is empty in which case it returns the other


        hcat is a list version of <>
        hsep is a list version of <+>
        vcat is a list version of $$

        sep (separate) is either like hsep or like vcat, depending on what fits

        cat  is behaves like sep,  but it uses <> for horizontal conposition
        fcat is behaves like fsep, but it uses <> for horizontal conposition

        These new ones do the obvious things:
                char, semi, comma, colon, space,
                parens, brackets, braces, 
                quotes, doubleQuotes
        
4.      The "above" combinator, $$, now overlaps its two arguments if the
        last line of the top argument stops before the first line of the second begins.
        For example:  text "hi" $$ nest 5 "there"
        lays out as
                        hi   there
        rather than
                        hi
                             there

        There are two places this is really useful

        a) When making labelled blocks, like this:
                Left ->   code for left
                Right ->  code for right
                LongLongLongLabel ->
                          code for longlonglonglabel
           The block is on the same line as the label if the label is
           short, but on the next line otherwise.

        b) When laying out lists like this:
                [ first
                , second
                , third
                ]
           which some people like.  But if the list fits on one line
           you want [first, second, third].  You can't do this with
           John's original combinators, but it's quite easy with the
           new $$.

        The combinator $+$ gives the original "never-overlap" behaviour.

5.      Several different renderers are provided:
                * a standard one
                * one that uses cut-marks to avoid deeply-nested documents 
                        simply piling up in the right-hand margin
                * one that ignores indentation (fewer chars output; good for machines)
                * one that ignores indentation and newlines (ditto, only more so)

6.      Numerous implementation tidy-ups
        Use of unboxed data types to speed up the implementation



\begin{code}
module Pretty (
        Doc,            -- Abstract
        Mode(..), TextDetails(..),

        empty, isEmpty, nest,

        text, char, ftext, ptext,
        int, integer, float, double, rational,
        parens, brackets, braces, quotes, doubleQuotes,
        semi, comma, colon, space, equals,
        lparen, rparen, lbrack, rbrack, lbrace, rbrace,

        (<>), (<+>), hcat, hsep, 
        ($$), ($+$), vcat, 
        sep, cat, 
        fsep, fcat, 

        hang, punctuate,

The @Doc@ combinators satisfy the following laws:
\begin{verbatim}
Laws for $$
~~~~~~~~~~~
<a1>    (x $$ y) $$ z   = x $$ (y $$ z)
<a2>    empty $$ x      = x
<a3>    x $$ empty      = x

        ...ditto $+$...

Laws for <>
~~~~~~~~~~~
<b1>    (x <> y) <> z   = x <> (y <> z)
<b2>    empty <> x      = empty
<b3>    x <> empty      = x

        ...ditto <+>...

Laws for text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<t1>    text s <> text t        = text (s++t)
<t2>    text "" <> x            = x, if x non-empty

Laws for nest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<n1>    nest 0 x                = x
<n2>    nest k (nest k' x)      = nest (k+k') x
<n3>    nest k (x <> y)         = nest k z <> nest k y
<n4>    nest k (x $$ y)         = nest k x $$ nest k y
<n5>    nest k empty            = empty
<n6>    x <> nest k y           = x <> y, if x non-empty

** Note the side condition on <n6>!  It is this that
** makes it OK for empty to be a left unit for <>.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<m1>    (text s <> x) $$ y = text s <> ((text "" <> x)) $$ 
                                         nest (-length s) y)

<m2>    (x $$ y) <> z = x $$ (y <> z)
        if y non-empty


Laws for list versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<l1>    sep (ps++[empty]++qs)   = sep (ps ++ qs)
        ...ditto hsep, hcat, vcat, fill...

<l2>    nest k (sep ps) = sep (map (nest k) ps)
        ...ditto hsep, hcat, vcat, fill...

Laws for oneLiner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<o1>    oneLiner (nest k p) = nest k (oneLiner p)
<o2>    oneLiner (x <> y)   = oneLiner x <> oneLiner y 
\end{verbatim}


You might think that the following verion of <m1> would
be neater:
\begin{verbatim}
<3 NO>  (text s <> x) $$ y = text s <> ((empty <> x)) $$ 
                                         nest (-length s) y)
\end{verbatim}
But it doesn't work, for if x=empty, we would have
\begin{verbatim}
        text s $$ y = text s <> (empty $$ nest (-length s) y)
                    = text s <> nest (-length s) y

A @Doc@ represents a {\em set} of layouts.  A @Doc@ with
no occurrences of @Union@ or @NoDoc@ represents just one layout.
\begin{code}
data Doc
 = Empty                                -- empty
 | NilAbove Doc                         -- text "" $$ x
 | TextBeside !TextDetails INT Doc       -- text s <> x  
 | Nest INT Doc                         -- nest k x
 | Union Doc Doc                        -- ul `union` ur
 | NoDoc                                -- The empty set of documents
 | Beside Doc Bool Doc                  -- True <=> space between
 | Above  Doc Bool Doc                  -- True <=> never overlap

type RDoc = Doc         -- RDoc is a "reduced Doc", guaranteed not to have a top-level Above or Beside


reduceDoc :: Doc -> RDoc
reduceDoc (Beside p g q) = beside p g (reduceDoc q)
reduceDoc (Above  p g q) = above  p g (reduceDoc q)
reduceDoc p              = p


data TextDetails = Chr  {-#UNPACK#-}!Char
                 | Str  String
                 | PStr FastString	-- a hashed string
		 | LStr Addr# Int#	-- a '\0'-terminated array of bytes

space_text = Chr ' '
nl_text    = Chr '\n'
\end{code}

Here are the invariants:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The argument of @NilAbove@ is never @Empty@. Therefore
a @NilAbove@ occupies at least two lines.

\item
The arugment of @TextBeside@ is never @Nest@.

\item 
The layouts of the two arguments of @Union@ both flatten to the same string.

\item 
The arguments of @Union@ are either @TextBeside@, or @NilAbove@.

\item
The right argument of a union cannot be equivalent to the empty set (@NoDoc@).
If the left argument of a union is equivalent to the empty set (@NoDoc@),
then the @NoDoc@ appears in the first line.

\item 
An empty document is always represented by @Empty@.
It can't be hidden inside a @Nest@, or a @Union@ of two @Empty@s.

\item 
The first line of every layout in the left argument of @Union@
is longer than the first line of any layout in the right argument.
(1) ensures that the left argument has a first line.  In view of (3),
this invariant means that the right argument must have at least two
lines.

nonEmptySet (TextBeside _ _ p) = nonEmptySet p
nonEmptySet (Nest _ p)         = nonEmptySet p
\end{code}

@oneLiner@ returns the one-line members of the given set of @Doc@s.

-- Printing output in LeftMode is performance critical: it's used when
-- dumping C and assembly output, so we allow ourselves a few dirty
-- hacks:
--
--	(1) we specialise fullRender for LeftMode with IO output.
--
--	(2) we add a layer of buffering on top of Handles.  Handles
--	    don't perform well with lots of hPutChars, which is mostly
--	    what we're doing here, because Handles have to be thread-safe
--	    and async exception-safe.  We only have a single thread and don't
--	    care about exceptions, so we add a layer of fast buffering
--	    over the Handle interface.
--
--	(3) a few hacks in layLeft below to convince GHC to generate the right
--	    code.
