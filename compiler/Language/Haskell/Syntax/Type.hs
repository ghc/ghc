Note [HsBSig binder lists]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a binder (or pattern) decorated with a type or kind,
   \ (x :: a -> a). blah
   forall (a :: k -> *) (b :: k). blah
Then we use a LHsBndrSig on the binder, so that the
renamer can decorate it with the variables bound
by the pattern ('a' in the first example, 'k' in the second),
assuming that neither of them is in scope already
See also Note [Kind and type-variable binders] in GHC.Rename.HsType

Note [HsType binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system for recording type and kind-variable binders in HsTypes
is a bit complicated.  Here's how it works.

* In a HsType,
     HsForAllTy   represents an /explicit, user-written/ 'forall' that
                  is nested within another HsType
                   e.g.   forall a b.   {...} or
                          forall a b -> {...}

                  Note that top-level 'forall's are represented with a
                  different AST form. See the description of HsOuterTyVarBndrs
                  below.
     HsQualTy     represents an /explicit, user-written/ context
                   e.g.   (Eq a, Show a) => ...
                  The context can be empty if that's what the user wrote
  These constructors represent what the user wrote, no more
  and no less.

* The ForAllTelescope field of HsForAllTy represents whether a forall is
  invisible (e.g., forall a b. {...}, with a dot) or visible
  (e.g., forall a b -> {...}, with an arrow).

* HsTyVarBndr describes a quantified type variable written by the
  user.  For example
     f :: forall a (b :: *).  blah
  here 'a' and '(b::*)' are each a HsTyVarBndr.  A HsForAllTy has
  a list of LHsTyVarBndrs.

* HsOuterTyVarBndrs is used to represent the outermost quantified type
  variables in a type that obeys the forall-or-nothing rule. An
  HsOuterTyVarBndrs can be one of the following:

    HsOuterImplicit (implicit quantification, added by renamer)
          f :: a -> a     -- Desugars to f :: forall {a}. a -> a
    HsOuterExplicit (explicit user quantification):
          f :: forall a. a -> a

  See Note [forall-or-nothing rule].

* An HsSigType is an LHsType with an accompanying HsOuterTyVarBndrs that
  represents the presence (or absence) of its outermost 'forall'.
  See Note [Representing type signatures].

* HsWildCardBndrs is a wrapper that binds the wildcard variables
  of the wrapped thing.  It is filled in by the renamer
     f :: _a -> _
  The enclosing HsWildCardBndrs binds the wildcards _a and _.

* HsSigPatType describes types that appear in pattern signatures and
  the signatures of term-level binders in RULES. Like
  HsWildCardBndrs/HsOuterTyVarBndrs, they track the names of wildcard
  variables and implicitly bound type variables. Unlike
  HsOuterTyVarBndrs, however, HsSigPatTypes do not obey the
  forall-or-nothing rule. See Note [Pattern signature binders and scoping].

* The explicit presence of these wrappers specifies, in the HsSyn,
  exactly where implicit quantification is allowed, and where
  wildcards are allowed.

* LHsQTyVars is used in data/class declarations, where the user gives
  explicit *type* variable bindings, but we need to implicitly bind
  *kind* variables.  For example
      class C (a :: k -> *) where ...
  The 'k' is implicitly bound in the hsq_tvs field of LHsQTyVars

Note [The wildcard story for types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Types can have wildcards in them, to support partial type signatures,
like       f :: Int -> (_ , _a) -> _a

A wildcard in a type can be

  * An anonymous wildcard,
        written '_'
    In HsType this is represented by HsWildCardTy.
    The renamer leaves it untouched, and it is later given a fresh
    meta tyvar in the typechecker.

  * A named wildcard,
        written '_a', '_foo', etc
    In HsType this is represented by (HsTyVar "_a")
    i.e. a perfectly ordinary type variable that happens
         to start with an underscore

Note carefully:

* When NamedWildCards is off, type variables that start with an
  underscore really /are/ ordinary type variables.  And indeed, even
  when NamedWildCards is on you can bind _a explicitly as an ordinary
  type variable:
        data T _a _b = MkT _b _a
  Or even:
        f :: forall _a. _a -> _b
  Here _a is an ordinary forall'd binder, but (With NamedWildCards)
  _b is a named wildcard.  (See the comments in #10982)

* Named wildcards are bound by the HsWildCardBndrs (for types that obey the
  forall-or-nothing rule) and HsPatSigType (for type signatures in patterns
  and term-level binders in RULES), which wrap types that are allowed to have
  wildcards. Unnamed wildcards, however are left unchanged until typechecking,
  where we give them fresh wild tyvars and determine whether or not to emit
  hole constraints on each wildcard (we don't if it's a visible type/kind
  argument or a type family pattern). See related notes
  Note [Wildcards in visible kind application] and
  Note [Wildcards in visible type application] in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.

* After type checking is done, we report what types the wildcards
  got unified with.

Note [Ordering of implicit variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the advent of -XTypeApplications, GHC makes promises about the ordering
of implicit variable quantification. Specifically, we offer that implicitly
quantified variables (such as those in const :: a -> b -> a, without a `forall`)
will occur in left-to-right order of first occurrence. Here are a few examples:

  const :: a -> b -> a       -- forall a b. ...
  f :: Eq a => b -> a -> a   -- forall a b. ...  contexts are included

  type a <-< b = b -> a
  g :: a <-< b               -- forall a b. ...  type synonyms matter

  class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b   -- forall f a b. ...
    -- The f is quantified by the class, so only a and b are considered in fmap

This simple story is complicated by the possibility of dependency: all variables
must come after any variables mentioned in their kinds.

  typeRep :: Typeable a => TypeRep (a :: k)   -- forall k a. ...

The k comes first because a depends on k, even though the k appears later than
the a in the code. Thus, GHC does a *stable topological sort* on the variables.
By "stable", we mean that any two variables who do not depend on each other
preserve their existing left-to-right ordering.

Implicitly bound variables are collected by the extract- family of functions
(extractHsTysRdrTyVars, extractHsTyVarBndrsKVs, etc.) in GHC.Rename.HsType.
These functions thus promise to keep left-to-right ordering.
Look for pointers to this note to see the places where the action happens.

Note that we also maintain this ordering in kind signatures. Even though
there's no visible kind application (yet), having implicit variables be
quantified in left-to-right order in kind signatures is nice since:

* It's consistent with the treatment for type signatures.
* It can affect how types are displayed with -fprint-explicit-kinds (see
  #15568 for an example), which is a situation where knowing the order in
  which implicit variables are quantified can be useful.
* In the event that visible kind application is implemented, the order in
  which we would expect implicit variables to be ordered in kinds will have
  already been established.

Note [forall-or-nothing rule]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Free variables in signatures are usually bound in an implicit 'forall' at the
beginning of user-written signatures. However, if the signature has an
explicit, invisible forall at the beginning, this is disabled. This is referred
to as the forall-or-nothing rule.

The idea is nested foralls express something which is only expressible
explicitly, while a top level forall could (usually) be replaced with an
implicit binding. Top-level foralls alone ("forall.") are therefore an
indication that the user is trying to be fastidious, so we don't implicitly
bind any variables.

Note that this rule only applies to outermost /in/visible 'forall's, and not
outermost visible 'forall's. See #18660 for more on this point.

Here are some concrete examples to demonstrate the forall-or-nothing rule in
action:

  type F1 :: a -> b -> b                    -- Legal; a,b are implicitly quantified.
                                            -- Equivalently: forall a b. a -> b -> b

  type F2 :: forall a b. a -> b -> b        -- Legal; explicitly quantified

  type F3 :: forall a. a -> b -> b          -- Illegal; the forall-or-nothing rule says that
                                            -- if you quantify a, you must also quantify b

  type F4 :: forall a -> b -> b             -- Legal; the top quantifier (forall a) is a /visible/
                                            -- quantifier, so the "nothing" part of the forall-or-nothing
                                            -- rule applies, and b is therefore implicitly quantified.
                                            -- Equivalently: forall b. forall a -> b -> b

  type F5 :: forall b. forall a -> b -> c   -- Illegal; the forall-or-nothing rule says that
                                            -- if you quantify b, you must also quantify c

  type F6 :: forall a -> forall b. b -> c   -- Legal: just like F4.

For a complete list of all places where the forall-or-nothing rule applies, see
"The `forall`-or-nothing rule" section of the GHC User's Guide.

Any type that obeys the forall-or-nothing rule is represented in the AST with
an HsOuterTyVarBndrs:

* If the type has an outermost, invisible 'forall', it uses HsOuterExplicit,
  which contains a list of the explicitly quantified type variable binders in
  `hso_bndrs`. After typechecking, HsOuterExplicit also stores a list of the
  explicitly quantified `InvisTVBinder`s in
  `hso_xexplicit :: XHsOuterExplicit GhcTc`.

* Otherwise, it uses HsOuterImplicit. HsOuterImplicit is used for different
  things depending on the phase:

  * After parsing, it does not store anything in particular.
  * After renaming, it stores the implicitly bound type variable `Name`s in
    `hso_ximplicit :: XHsOuterImplicit GhcRn`.
  * After typechecking, it stores the implicitly bound `TyVar`s in
    `hso_ximplicit :: XHsOuterImplicit GhcTc`.

  NB: this implicit quantification is purely lexical: we bind any
      type or kind variables that are not in scope. The type checker
      may subsequently quantify over further kind variables.
      See Note [Binding scoped type variables] in GHC.Tc.Gen.Sig.

HsOuterTyVarBndrs GhcTc is used in the typechecker as an intermediate data type
for storing the outermost TyVars/InvisTVBinders in a type.
See GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.bindOuterTKBndrsX for an example of this.

Note [Representing type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HsSigType is used to represent an explicit user type signature. These are
used in a variety of places. Some examples include:

* Type signatures (e.g., f :: a -> a)
* Standalone kind signatures (e.g., type G :: a -> a)
* GADT constructor types (e.g., data T where MkT :: a -> T)

A HsSigType is the combination of an HsOuterSigTyVarBndrs and an LHsType:

* The HsOuterSigTyVarBndrs binds the /explicitly/ quantified type variables
  when the type signature has an outermost, user-written 'forall' (i.e,
  the HsOuterExplicit constructor is used). If there is no outermost 'forall',
  then it binds the /implicitly/ quantified type variables instead (i.e.,
  the HsOuterImplicit constructor is used).
* The LHsType represents the rest of the type.

E.g. For a signature like
   f :: forall k (a::k). blah
we get
   HsSig { sig_bndrs = HsOuterExplicit { hso_bndrs = [k, (a :: k)] }
         , sig_body  = blah }

Note [Pattern signature binders and scoping]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the pattern signatures like those on `t` and `g` in:

   f = let h = \(t :: (b, b) ->
               \(g :: forall a. a -> b) ->
               ...(t :: (Int,Int))...
       in woggle

* The `b` in t's pattern signature is implicitly bound and scopes over
  the signature and the body of the lambda.  It stands for a type (any type);
  indeed we subsequently discover that b=Int.
  (See Note [TyVarTv] in GHC.Tc.Utils.TcMType for more on this point.)
* The `b` in g's pattern signature is an /occurrence/ of the `b` bound by
  t's pattern signature.
* The `a` in `forall a` scopes only over the type `a -> b`, not over the body
  of the lambda.
* There is no forall-or-nothing rule for pattern signatures, which is why the
  type `forall a. a -> b` is permitted in `g`'s pattern signature, even though
  `b` is not explicitly bound. See Note [forall-or-nothing rule].

Similar scoping rules apply to term variable binders in RULES, like in the
following example:

   {-# RULES "h" forall (t :: (b, b)) (g :: forall a. a -> b). h t g = ... #-}

Just like in pattern signatures, the `b` in t's signature is implicitly bound
and scopes over the remainder of the RULE. As a result, the `b` in g's
signature is an occurrence. Moreover, the `a` in `forall a` scopes only over
the type `a -> b`, and the forall-or-nothing rule does not apply.

While quite similar, RULE term binder signatures behave slightly differently
from pattern signatures in two ways:

1. Unlike in pattern signatures, where type variables can stand for any type,
   type variables in RULE term binder signatures are skolems.
   See Note [Typechecking pattern signature binders] in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType for
   more on this point.

   In this sense, type variables in pattern signatures are quite similar to
   named wildcards, as both can refer to arbitrary types. The main difference
   lies in error reporting: if a named wildcard `_a` in a pattern signature
   stands for Int, then by default GHC will emit a warning stating as much.
   Changing `_a` to `a`, on the other hand, will cause it not to be reported.
2. In the `h` RULE above, only term variables are explicitly bound, so any free
   type variables in the term variables' signatures are implicitly bound.
   This is just like how the free type variables in pattern signatures are
   implicitly bound. If a RULE explicitly binds both term and type variables,
   however, then free type variables in term signatures are /not/ implicitly
   bound. For example, this RULE would be ill scoped:

     {-# RULES "h2" forall b. forall (t :: (b, c)) (g :: forall a. a -> b).
                    h2 t g = ... #-}

   This is because `b` and `c` occur free in the signature for `t`, but only
   `b` was explicitly bound, leaving `c` out of scope. If the RULE had started
   with `forall b c.`, then it would have been accepted.

The types in pattern signatures and RULE term binder signatures are represented
in the AST by HsSigPatType. From the renamer onward, the hsps_ext field (of
type HsPSRn) tracks the names of named wildcards and implicitly bound type
variables so that they can be brought into scope during renaming and
typechecking.

Note [Lexically scoped type variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ScopedTypeVariables extension does two things:

* It allows the use of type signatures in patterns
  (e.g., `f (x :: a -> a) = ...`). See
  Note [Pattern signature binders and scoping] for more on this point.
* It brings lexically scoped type variables into scope for certain type
  signatures with outermost invisible 'forall's.

This Note concerns the latter bullet point. Per the
"Lexically scoped type variables" section of the GHC User's Guide, the
following forms of type signatures can have lexically scoped type variables:

* In declarations with type signatures, e.g.,

    f :: forall a. a -> a
    f x = e @a

  Here, the 'forall a' brings 'a' into scope over the body of 'f'.

  Note that ScopedTypeVariables does /not/ interact with standalone kind
  signatures, only type signatures.

* In explicit type annotations in expressions, e.g.,

    id @a :: forall a. a -> a

* In instance declarations, e.g.,

    instance forall a. C [a] where
      m = e @a

  Note that unlike the examples above, the use of an outermost 'forall' isn't
  required to bring 'a' into scope. That is, the following would also work:

    instance forall a. C [a] where
      m = e @a

Note that all of the types above obey the forall-or-nothing rule. As a result,
the places in the AST that can have lexically scoped type variables are a
subset of the places that use HsOuterTyVarBndrs
(See Note [forall-or-nothing rule].)

Some other observations about lexically scoped type variables:

* Only type variables bound by an /invisible/ forall can be lexically scoped.
  See Note [hsScopedTvs and visible foralls].
* The lexically scoped type variables may be a strict subset of the type
  variables brought into scope by a type signature.
  See Note [Binding scoped type variables] in GHC.Tc.Gen.Sig.

{- Note [Type variable binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type variable binders, represented by the HsTyVarBndr type, can occur in the
following contexts:

1. On the left-hand sides of type/class declarations (TyClDecl)

      data D a b = ...       -- data types     (DataDecl)
      newtype N a b = ...    -- newtypes       (DataDecl)
      type T a b = ...       -- type synonyms  (SynDecl)
      class C a b where ...  -- classes        (ClassDecl)
      type family TF a b     -- type families  (FamDecl)
      data family DF a b     -- data families  (FamDecl)

   The `a` and `b` in these examples are type variable binders.

2. In forall telescopes (HsForAllTy and HsOuterTyVarBndrs)

    2-Invis. forall {a} b. ...    -- invisible forall (HsForAllInvis)
    2-Vis.   forall a b -> ...    -- visible forall   (HsForAllVis)

   Again, `a` and `b` are type variable binders.

3. In type family result signatures (FamilyResultSig), which are
   part of the TypeFamilyDependencies extension

      type family F a = r | r -> a  -- result sig (TyVarSig)

   The `r` immediately to the right of `=` is a type variable binder.

4. In constructor patterns, as long as the conditions outlined in
   Note [Type patterns: binders and unifiers] are satisfied

      fn (MkT @a @b x y) = ...  -- invisible type arguments (InvisPat)
                                -- in constructor patterns (ConPat)

   Here, the `a` and `b` are type variable binders iff
   `GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.tyPatToBndr` returns `Just`.

A type variable binder has three parts:
  * flag      (HsBndrVis, Specificity, or () -- depending on context)
  * variable  (HsBndrVar)
  * kind      (HsBndrKind)

Details about each part:

* The binder variable (HsBndrVar) is either a type variable name or a wildcard,
  i.e. `a` vs `_` (HsBndrVar vs HsBndrWildCard).

* The binder kind (HsBndrKind) stores the optional kind annotation,
  i.e. `a` vs `a :: k` (HsBndrNoKind vs HsBndrKind).

* The binder flag is instantiated to one of the following types,
  depending on the context where it occurs (contexts 1..4 are listed above)

    (a) flag=HsBndrVis records `a` vs `@a` (HsBndrRequired vs HsBndrInvisible)
          (used in contexts: 1)
    (b) flag=Specificity records `a` vs `{a}` (SpecifiedSpec vs InferredSpec)
          (used in contexts: 2-Invis)
    (c) flag=() is used when there is no distinction to record
          (used in contexts: 2-Vis, 3, 4)

All in all, we have the following forms of type variable binders in the language

  a, (a :: k), @a, @(a :: k), {a}, {a :: k}
  _, (_ :: k), @_, @(_ :: k)

The forms {_}, {_ :: k} are representable but never valid, see

Note [Unit tuples]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the type
    type instance F Int = ()
We want to parse that "()"
    as HsTupleTy HsBoxedOrConstraintTuple [],
NOT as HsTyVar unitTyCon

Why? Because F might have kind (* -> Constraint), so we when parsing we
don't know if that tuple is going to be a constraint tuple or an ordinary
unit tuple.  The HsTupleSort flag is specifically designed to deal with
that, but it has to work for unit tuples too.

Note [Promotions (HsTyVar)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HsTyVar: A name in a type or kind.
  Here are the allowed namespaces for the name.
    In a type:
      Var: not allowed
      Data: promoted data constructor
      Tv: type variable
      TcCls before renamer: type constructor, class constructor, or promoted data constructor
      TcCls after renamer: type constructor or class constructor
    In a kind:
      Var, Data: not allowed
      Tv: kind variable
      TcCls: kind constructor or promoted type constructor

  The 'Promoted' field in an HsTyVar captures whether the type was promoted in
  the source code by prefixing an apostrophe.

Note [HsStarTy]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the StarIsType extension is enabled, we want to treat '*' and its Unicode
variant identically to 'Data.Kind.Type'. Unfortunately, doing so in the parser
would mean that when we pretty-print it back, we don't know whether the user
wrote '*' or 'Type', and lose the parse/ppr roundtrip property.

As a workaround, we parse '*' as HsStarTy (if it stands for 'Data.Kind.Type')
and then desugar it to 'Data.Kind.Type' in the typechecker (see tcHsType).
When '*' is a regular type operator (StarIsType is disabled), HsStarTy is not
involved.


Note [Promoted lists and tuples]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notice the difference between
   HsListTy    HsExplicitListTy
   HsTupleTy   HsExplicitListTupleTy

E.g.    f :: [Int]                      HsListTy

        g3  :: T '[]                   All these use
        g2  :: T '[True]                  HsExplicitListTy
        g1  :: T '[True,False]
        g1a :: T [True,False]             (can omit ' where unambiguous)

  kind of T :: [Bool] -> *        This kind uses HsListTy!

E.g.    h :: (Int,Bool)                 HsTupleTy; f is a pair
        k :: S '(True,False)            HsExplicitTypleTy; S is indexed by
                                           a type-level pair of booleans
        kind of S :: (Bool,Bool) -> *   This kind uses HsExplicitTupleTy

Note [Distinguishing tuple kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from promotion, tuples can have one of three different kinds:

        x :: (Int, Bool)                -- Regular boxed tuples
        f :: Int# -> (# Int#, Int# #)   -- Unboxed tuples
        g :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a         -- Constraint tuples

For convenience, internally we use a single constructor for all of these,
namely HsTupleTy, but keep track of the tuple kind (in the first argument to
HsTupleTy, a HsTupleSort). We can tell if a tuple is unboxed while parsing,
because of the #. However, with -XConstraintKinds we can only distinguish
between constraint and boxed tuples during type checking, in general. Hence the
two constructors of HsTupleSort:

        HsUnboxedTuple                  -> Produced by the parser
        HsBoxedOrConstraintTuple        -> Could be a boxed or a constraint
                                        tuple. Produced by the parser only,
                                        disappears after type checking

After typechecking, we use TupleSort (which clearly distinguishes between
constraint tuples and boxed tuples) rather than HsTupleSort.

  e.g.  data T1 a = MkT (Maybe a) !Int
* GADT-style declarations with arrow syntax
  e.g.  data T2 a where MkT :: Maybe a -> !Int -> T2 a
* GADT-style declarations with record syntax
  e.g.  data T3 a where MkT :: { x :: Maybe a, y :: !Int } -> T3 a

Each argument type is decorated with any user-defined
  a) UNPACK pragma `cdf_unpack`
  b) strictness annotation `cdf_bang`
  c) multiplicity annotation `cdf_multiplicity`
     In the case of Haskell-98 style declarations, this only applies to record syntax.
  d) documentation `cdf_doc`

{- Note [Scoping of named wildcards]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  f :: _a -> _a
  f x = let g :: _a -> _a
            g = ...
        in ...

Currently, for better or worse, the "_a" variables are all the same. So
although there is no explicit forall, the "_a" scopes over the definition.
I don't know if this is a good idea, but there it is.
-}

{- Note [hsScopedTvs and visible foralls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ScopedTypeVariables can be defined in terms of a desugaring to TypeAbstractions
(GHC Proposals #155 and #448):

    fn :: forall a b c. tau(a,b,c)            fn :: forall a b c. tau(a,b,c)
    fn = defn(a,b,c)                   ==>    fn @x @y @z = defn(x,y,z)

That is, for every type variable of the leading `forall` in the type signature,
we add an invisible binder at the term level.

This model does not extend to visible forall. (Visible forall is the one written
with an arrow instead of a dot, i.e. `forall a ->`. See GHC Proposal #281 and
the RequiredTypeArguments extension).  Here is an example that demonstrates the
issue:

  vfn :: forall a b -> tau(a, b)
  vfn = case <scrutinee> of (p,q) -> \x y -> ...

The `a` and `b` cannot scope over the equations of `vfn`.  In particular,
`a` and `b` cannot be in scope in <scrutinee> because those type variables
are bound by the `\x y ->`.

Our solution is simple: ScopedTypeVariables has no effect on visible forall.
It follows naturally from the fact that ScopedTypeVariables is already subject
to several restrictions:

  1. The type signature must be headed by an /explicit/ forall
      * `f :: forall a. a -> blah` brings `a` into scope in the body
      * `f ::           a -> blah` does not

  2. The forall is /not nested/
      * `f :: forall a b. blah`         brings `a` and `b` into scope in the body
      * `f :: forall a. forall b. blah` brings `a` but not `b` into scope in the body

With the introduction of visible forall, we also introduce a third condition:

  3. The forall has to be /invisible/
      * `f :: forall a b.   blah` brings `a` and `b` into scope in the body
      * `f :: forall a b -> blah` does not

For example:

   f1 :: forall a. a -> a
   f1 x = (x::a)          -- OK: `a` is in scope in the body

   f2 :: forall a b. a -> b -> (a, b)
   f2 x y = (x::a, y::b)  -- OK: both `a` and `b` are in scope in the body

   f3 :: forall a. forall b. a -> b -> (a, b)
   f3 x y = (x::a, y::b)  -- Wrong: the `forall b.` is not the outermost forall

   f4 :: forall a -> a -> a
   f4 t (x::t) = (x::a)   -- Wrong: the `forall a ->` does not bring `a` into scope

This design choice is reflected in the definition of HsOuterSigTyVarBndrs, which are
used in every place where ScopedTypeVariables takes effect:

  data HsOuterTyVarBndrs flag pass
    = HsOuterImplicit { ... }
    | HsOuterExplicit { ..., hso_bndrs :: [LHsTyVarBndr flag pass] }
    | ...
  type HsOuterSigTyVarBndrs = HsOuterTyVarBndrs Specificity

The HsOuterExplicit constructor is only used in type signatures with outermost,
/invisible/ 'forall's. Any other type—including those with outermost,
/visible/ 'forall's—will use HsOuterImplicit. Therefore, when we determine
which type variables to bring into scope over the body of a function
(in hsScopedTvs), we /only/ bring the type variables bound by the hso_bndrs in
an HsOuterExplicit into scope. If we have an HsOuterImplicit instead, then we
do not bring any type variables into scope over the body of a function at all.

A HsArgPar indicates that everything to the left of this in the argument list is
enclosed in parentheses together with the function itself. It is necessary so
that we can recreate the parenthesis structure in the original source after
typechecking the arguments.

The foLabel field of FieldOcc GhcRn contains the field name as the user wrote it.
After the renamer, a FieldOcc GhcTc has
- foExt field: A RdrName containing the original field label written by the user
- foLabel field: An Id for the field selector, whose OccName may have been mangled
  to give it a globally unique identity.

For example, when DuplicateRecordFields is enabled

    data T = MkT { x :: Int }
