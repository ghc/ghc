Note [Trees That Grow]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/implementing-trees-that-grow

The hsSyn AST is reused across multiple compiler passes. We also have the
Template Haskell AST, and the haskell-src-exts one (outside of GHC)

Supporting multiple passes means the AST has various warts on it to cope with
the specifics for the phases, such as the 'ValBindsOut', 'ConPatOut',
'SigPatOut' etc.

The growable AST will allow each of these variants to be captured explicitly,
such that they only exist in the given compiler pass AST, as selected by the
type parameter to the AST.

In addition it will allow tool writers to define their own extensions to capture
additional information for the tool, in a natural way.

A further goal is to provide a means to harmonise the Template Haskell and
haskell-src-exts ASTs as well.

Wrinkle: In order to print out the AST, we need to know it is Outputable.
We also sometimes need to branch on the particular pass that we're in
(e.g. to print out type information once we know it). In order to allow
both of these actions, we define OutputableBndrId, which gathers the necessary
OutputableBndr and IsPass constraints. The use of this constraint in instances
generally requires UndecidableInstances.

See also Note [IsPass] and Note [NoGhcTc] in GHC.Hs.Extension.

Note [Constructor cannot occur]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some data constructors can't occur in certain phases; e.g. the output
of the type checker never has OverLabel. We signal this by
* setting the extension field to DataConCantHappen
* using dataConCantHappen in the cases that can't happen

For example:

   type instance XOverLabel GhcTc = DataConCantHappen

   dsExpr :: HsExpr GhcTc -> blah
   dsExpr (HsOverLabel x _) = dataConCantHappen x

The function dataConCantHappen is defined thus:
   dataConCantHappen :: DataConCantHappen -> a
   dataConCantHappen x = case x of {}
(i.e. identically to Data.Void.absurd, but more helpfully named).
Remember DataConCantHappen is a type whose only element is bottom.

This should not be confused with 'NoExtField', which are found in unused
extension /points/ (not /constructors/) and therefore can be inhabited.

It would be better to omit the pattern match altogether, but we
can only do that if the extension field was strict (#18764).
See also [DataConCantHappen and strict fields].

Note [XRec and SrcSpans in the AST]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XRec is meant to replace most of the uses of `Located` in the AST. It is another
extension point meant to make it easier for non-GHC applications to reuse the
AST for their own purposes, and not have to deal the hassle of (perhaps) useless
SrcSpans everywhere.

instead of `Located (HsExpr p)` or similar types, we will now have `XRec p
(HsExpr p)`

XRec allows annotating certain points in the AST with extra
information. This maybe be source spans (for GHC), nothing (for TH),
types (for HIE files), exact print annotations (for exactprint) or
anything else.

This should hopefully bring us one step closer to sharing the AST between GHC
and TH.

We use the `UnXRec`, `MapXRec` and `WrapXRec` type classes to aid us in writing
pass-polymorphic code that deals with `XRec`s
-}

-- | We can strip off the XRec to access the underlying data.
-- See Note [XRec and SrcSpans in the AST]
class UnXRec p where
  unXRec :: XRec p a -> a

-- | We can map over the underlying type contained in an @XRec@ while preserving
-- the annotation as is.
class MapXRec p where
  mapXRec :: (Anno a ~ Anno b) => (a -> b) -> XRec p a -> XRec p b
-- See Note [XRec and SrcSpans in the AST]
-- See Note [XRec and Anno in the AST] in GHC.Parser.Annotation
-- AZ: Is there a way to not have Anno in this file, but still have MapXRec?
--     Perhaps define XRec with an additional b parameter, only used in Hs as (Anno b)?

-- | The trivial wrapper that carries no additional information
-- See Note [XRec and SrcSpans in the AST]
class WrapXRec p a where
  wrapXRec :: a -> XRec p a

-- | Maps the "normal" id type for a given pass
type family IdP p

type LIdP p = XRec p (IdP p)

-- | Like 'IdP', except it keeps track of the user-written module qualification,
-- if any.
--
-- See Note [IdOcc].
type family IdOccP p
type LIdOccP p = XRec p (IdOccP p)

{- Note [IdOcc]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When possible, in error messages we would like to report identifiers with the
qualification that the user has written (provided this does not cause any
ambiguity). To do this, we record the user-written qualification in the
AST in the GhcRn stage. This is achieved with the 'WithUserRdr' data type.
Thus:

  - instead of using 'IdP', we use 'IdOccP', which wraps an 'IdP' in
    'WithUserRdr' at GhcRn pass, in:
      - 'HsVar'
      - 'HsTyVar' (which is used for 'TyCon's, not just type variables)
      - 'HsOpTy'
  - we also use 'ConLikeP' which wraps a 'Name' in 'WithUserRdr' at 'GhcRn'
    pass, in:
      - 'RecordCon'
      - 'ConPat'

This user-written module qualification is then consulted when pretty-printing
expressions, e.g. we have:

  - ppr_expr (HsVar _ (L _ v)) = pprPrefixOcc v

and 'pprPrefixOcc' uses the 'OutputableBndr' instance for 'WithUserRdr'.
This happens in 'GHC.Types.Name.Ppr.mkQualName'.

Test case: T25877.
