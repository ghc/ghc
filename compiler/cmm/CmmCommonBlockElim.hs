-- Eliminate common blocks

-- If two blocks are identical except for the label on the first node,
-- then we can eliminate one of the blocks. To ensure that the semantics
-- of the program are preserved, we have to rewrite each predecessor of the
-- eliminated block to proceed with the block we keep.

-- The algorithm iterates over the blocks in the graph,
-- checking whether it has seen another block that is equal modulo labels.
-- If so, then it adds an entry in a map indicating that the new block
-- is made redundant by the old block.
-- Otherwise, it is added to the useful blocks.

-- To avoid comparing every block with every other block repeatedly, we group
-- them by
--   * a hash of the block, ignoring labels (explained below)
--   * the list of outgoing labels
-- The hash is invariant under relabeling, so we only ever compare within
-- the same group of blocks.
--
-- The list of outgoing labels is updated as we merge blocks (that is why they
-- are not included in the hash, which we want to calculate only once).
--
-- All in all, two blocks should never be compared if they have different
-- hashes, and at most once otherwise. Previously, we were slower, and people
-- rightfully complained: #10397

-- TODO: Use optimization fuel

-- Hashing and equality on blocks

-- Below here is mostly boilerplate: hashing blocks ignoring labels,
-- and comparing blocks modulo a label mapping.

-- To speed up comparisons, we hash each basic block modulo jump labels.
-- The hashing is a bit arbitrary (the numbers are completely arbitrary),
-- but it should be fast and good enough.

-- We want to get as many small buckets as possible, as comparing blocks is
-- expensive. So include as much as possible in the hash. Ideally everything
-- that is compared with (==) in eqBlockBodyWith.
