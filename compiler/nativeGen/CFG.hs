{- Note [Updating the CFG during shortcutting]

See Note [What is shortcutting] in the control flow optimization
code (CmmContFlowOpt.hs) for a slightly more in depth explanation on shortcutting.

In the native backend we shortcut jumps at the assembly level. (AsmCodeGen.hs)
This means we remove blocks containing only one jump from the code
and instead redirecting all jumps targeting this block to the deleted
blocks jump target.

However we want to have an accurate representation of control
flow in the CFG. So we add/remove edges accordingly to account
for the eliminated blocks and new edges.

If we shortcut A -> B -> C to A -> C:
* We delete edges A -> B and B -> C
* Replacing them with the edge A -> C

We also try to preserve jump weights while doing so.

Note that:
* The edge B -> C can't have interesting weights since
  the block B consists of a single unconditional jump without branching.
* We delete the edge A -> B and add the edge A -> C.
* The edge A -> B can be one of many edges originating from A so likely
  has edge weights we want to preserve.

For this reason we simply store the edge info from the original A -> B
edge and apply this information to the new edge A -> C.

Sometimes we have a scenario where jump target C is not represented by an
BlockId but an immediate value. I'm only aware of this happening without
tables next to code currently.

Then we go from A ---> B - -> IMM   to   A - -> IMM where the dashed arrows
are not stored in the CFG.

In that case we simply delete the edge A -> B.

In terms of implementation the native backend first builds a mapping
from blocks suitable for shortcutting to their jump targets.
Then it redirects all jump instructions to these blocks using the
built up mapping.
This function (shortcutWeightMap) takes the same mapping and
applies the mapping to the CFG in the way layed out above.

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ~~~       Note [CFG Edge Weights]    ~~~
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Edge weights assigned do not currently represent a specific
  cost model and rather just a ranking of which blocks should
  be placed next to each other given their connection type in
  the CFG.
  This is especially relevant if we whenever two blocks will
  jump to the same target.

                     A   B
                      \ /
                       C

  Should A or B be placed in front of C? The block layout algorithm
  decides this based on which edge (A,C)/(B,C) is heavier. So we
  make a educated guess how often execution will transer control
  along each edge as well as how much we gain by placing eg A before
  C.

  We rank edges in this order:
  * Unconditional Control Transfer - They will always
    transfer control to their target. Unless there is a info table
    we can turn the jump into a fallthrough as well.
    We use 20k as default, so it's easy to spot if values have been
    modified but unlikely that we run into issues with overflow.
  * If branches (likely) - We assume branches marked as likely
    are taken more than 80% of the time.
    By ranking them below unconditional jumps we make sure we
    prefer the unconditional if there is a conditional and
    unconditional edge towards a block.
  * If branches (regular) - The false branch can potentially be turned
    into a fallthrough so we prefer it slightly over the true branch.
  * Unlikely branches - These can be assumed to be taken less than 20%
    of the time. So we given them one of the lowest priorities.
  * Switches - Switches at this level are implemented as jump tables
    so have a larger number of successors. So without more information
    we can only say that each individual successor is unlikely to be
    jumped to and we rank them accordingly.
  * Calls - We currently ignore calls completly:
        * By the time we return from a call there is a good chance
          that the address we return to has already been evicted from
          cache eliminating a main advantage sequential placement brings.
        * Calls always require a info table in front of their return
          address. This reduces the chance that we return to the same
          cache line further.
