  We have a CFG with edge weights based on which we try to place blocks next to
  each other.

  Edge weights not only represent likelyhood of control transfer between blocks
  but also how much a block would benefit from being placed sequentially after
  it's predecessor.
  For example blocks which are preceeded by an info table are more likely to end
  up in a different cache line than their predecessor. So there is less benefit
  in placing them sequentially.

  For example consider this example:

  A:  ...
      jmp cond D (weak successor)
      jmp B
  B:  ...
      jmp C
  C:  ...
      jmp X
  D:  ...
      jmp B (weak successor)

  We determine a block layout by building up chunks (calling them chains) of
  possible control flows for which blocks will be placed sequentially.

  Eg for our example we might end up with two chains like:
  [A->B->C->X],[D]. Blocks inside chains will always be placed sequentially.
  However there is no particular order in which chains are placed since
  (hopefully) the blocks for which sequentially is important have already
  been placed in the same chain.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      First try to create a lists of good chains.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We do so by taking a block not yet placed in a chain and
  looking at these cases:

  *)  Check if the best predecessor of the block is at the end of a chain.
      If so add the current block to the end of that chain.

      Eg if we look at block C and already have the chain (A -> B)
      then we extend the chain to (A -> B -> C).

      Combined with the fact that we process blocks in reverse post order
      this means loop bodies and trivially sequential control flow already
      ends up as a single chain.

  *)  Otherwise we create a singleton chain from the block we are looking at.
      Eg if we have from the example above already constructed (A->B)
      and look at D we create the chain (D) resulting in the chains [A->B, D]

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      We then try to fuse chains.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are edge cases which result in two chains being created which trivially
  represent linear control flow. For example we might have the chains
  [(A-B-C),(D-E)] with an cfg triangle:

      A----->C->D->E
       \->B-/

  We also get three independent chains if two branches end with a jump
  to a common successor.

  We take care of these cases by fusing chains which are connected by an
  edge.

  We do so by looking at the list of edges sorted by weight.
  Given the edge (C -> D) we try to find two chains such that:
      * C is at the end of chain one.
      * D is in front of chain two.
      * If two such chains exist we fuse them.
  We then remove the edge and repeat the process for the rest of the edges.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Place indirect successors (neighbours) after each other
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We might have chains [A,B,C,X],[E] in a CFG of the sort:

    A ---> B ---> C --------> X(exit)
                   \- ->E- -/

  While E does not follow X it's still beneficial to place them near each other.
  This can be advantageous if eg C,X,E will end up in the same cache line.

  TODO: If we remove edges as we use them (eg if we build up A->B remove A->B
        from the list) we could save some more work in later phases.


  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ~~~ Note [Triangle Control Flow]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Checking if an argument is already evaluating leads to a somewhat
  special case  which looks like this:

    A:
        if (R1 & 7 != 0) goto Leval; else goto Lwork;
    Leval: // global
        call (I64[R1])(R1) returns to Lwork, args: 8, res: 8, upd: 8;
    Lwork: // global
        ...

        A
        |\
        | Leval
        |/ - (This edge can be missing because of optimizations)
        Lwork

  Once we hit the metal the call instruction is just 2-3 bytes large
  depending on the register used. So we lay out the assembly like this:

        movq %rbx,%rax
        andl $7,%eax
        cmpq $1,%rax
        jne Lwork
    Leval:
        jmp *(%rbx) # encoded in 2-3 bytes.
    <info table>
    Lwork:
        ...

  We could explicitly check for this control flow pattern.

  This is advantageous because:
  * It's optimal if the argument isn't evaluated.
  * If it's evaluated we only have the extra cost of jumping over
    the 2-3 bytes for the call.
  * Guarantees the smaller encoding for the conditional jump.

  However given that Lwork usually has an info table we
  penalize this edge. So Leval should get placed first
  either way and things work out for the best.

  Optimizing for the evaluated case instead would penalize
  the other code path. It adds an jump as we can't fall through
  to Lwork because of the info table.
  Assuming that Lwork is large the chance that the "call" ends up
  in the same cache line is also fairly small.

-- In this phase, we attempt to place the basic blocks in a sequence
-- such that as many of the local jumps as possible turn into
-- fallthroughs.

-- The old algorithm:
-- It is very simple (and stupid): We make a graph out of
-- the blocks where there is an edge from one block to another iff the
-- first block ends by jumping to the second.  Then we topologically
-- sort this graph.  Then traverse the list: for each block, we first
-- output the block, then if it has an out edge, we move the
-- destination of the out edge to the front of the list, and continue.

-- FYI, the classic layout for basic blocks uses postorder DFS; this
-- algorithm is implemented in Hoopl.
