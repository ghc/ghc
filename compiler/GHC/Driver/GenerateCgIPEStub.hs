Note [Stacktraces from Info Table Provenance Entries (IPE based stack unwinding)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stacktraces can be created from return frames as they are pushed to stack for every case scrutinee.
But to make them readable / meaningful, one needs to know the source location of each return frame.

Every return frame has a distinct info table and thus a distinct code pointer (for tables next to
code) or at least a distinct address itself. Info Table Provenance Entries (IPEs) are searchable by
this pointer and contain a source location.

The info table / info table code pointer to source location map is described in:
Note [Mapping Info Tables to Source Positions]

To be able to lookup IPEs for return frames one needs to emit them during compile time. This is done
by `generateCgIPEStub`.

This leads to the question: How to figure out the source location of a return frame?

The algorithm for determining source locations for stack info tables is implemented in
`lookupEstimatedTicks` as two passes over every 'CmmGroupSRTs'. The first pass generates estimated
source locations for any labels potentially corresponding to stack info tables in the Cmm code. The
second pass walks over the Cmm decls and creates an entry in the IPE map for every info table,
looking up source locations for stack info tables in the map generated during the first pass.

The rest of this note will document exactly how the first pass generates the map from labels to
estimated source positions. The algorithms are different depending on whether tables-next-to-code
is on or off. Both algorithms have in common that we are looking for a `CmmNode.CmmTick`
(containing a `SourceNote`) that is near what we estimate to be the label of a return stack frame.

With tables-next-to-code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's consider this example:
```
 Main.returnFrame_entry() { //  [R2]
         { info_tbls: [(c18g,
                        label: block_c18g_info
                        rep: StackRep []
                        srt: Just GHC.CString.unpackCString#_closure),
                       (c18r,
                        label: Main.returnFrame_info
                        rep: HeapRep static { Fun {arity: 1 fun_type: ArgSpec 5} }
                        srt: Nothing)]
           stack_info: arg_space: 8
         }
     {offset

      [...]

       c18u: // global
           //tick src<Main.hs:(7,1)-(16,15)>
           I64[Hp - 16] = sat_s16B_info;
           P64[Hp] = _s16r::P64;
           _c17j::P64 = Hp - 16;
           //tick src<Main.hs:8:25-39>
           I64[Sp - 8] = c18g;
           R3 = _c17j::P64;
           R2 = GHC.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO_closure;
           R1 = GHC.Base.$_closure;
           Sp = Sp - 8;
           call stg_ap_pp_fast(R3,
                               R2,
                               R1) returns to c18g, args: 8, res: 8, upd: 8;
```

The return frame `block_c18g_info` has the label `c18g` which is used in the call to `stg_ap_pp_fast`
(`returns to c18g`) as continuation (`cml_cont`). The source location we're after, is the nearest
`//tick` before the call (`//tick src<Main.hs:8:25-39>`).

In code the Cmm program is represented as a Hoopl graph. Hoopl distinguishes nodes by defining if they
are open or closed on entry (one can fallthrough to them from the previous instruction) and if they are
open or closed on exit (one can fallthrough from them to the next node).

Please refer to the paper "Hoopl: A Modular, Reusable Library for Dataflow Analysis and Transformation"
for a detailed explanation.

Here we use the fact, that calls (represented by `CmmNode.CmmCall`) are always closed on exit
(`CmmNode O C`, `O` means open, `C` closed). In other words, they are always at the end of a block.

So, given a `CmmGraph`:
  - Look at the end of every block: If it is a `CmmNode.CmmCall` returning to some label, lookup
    the nearest `CmmNode.CmmTick` by traversing the middle part of the block backwards (from end to
    beginning).
  - Take the first `CmmNode.CmmTick` that contains a `Tickish.SourceNote` and map the label we
    found to it's payload as an `IpeSourceLocation`. (There are other `Tickish` constructors like
    `ProfNote` or `HpcTick`, these are ignored.)

See `labelsToSourcesWithTNTC` for the implementation of this algorithm.

Without tables-next-to-code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When tables-next-to-code is off, there is no return frame / continuation label in calls. The continuation (i.e. return
frame) is set in an explicit Cmm assignment. Thus the tick lookup algorithm has to be slightly different.

```
 sat_s16G_entry() { //  [R1]
         { info_tbls: [(c18O,
                        label: sat_s16G_info
                        rep: HeapRep { Thunk }
                        srt: Just _u18Z_srt)]
           stack_info: arg_space: 0
         }
     {offset
       c18O: // global
           _s16G::P64 = R1;
           if ((Sp + 8) - 40 < SpLim) (likely: False) goto c18P; else goto c18Q;
       c18P: // global
           R1 = _s16G::P64;
           call (stg_gc_enter_1)(R1) args: 8, res: 0, upd: 8;
       c18Q: // global
           I64[Sp - 16] = stg_upd_frame_info;
           P64[Sp - 8] = _s16G::P64;
           //tick src<Main.hs:20:9-13>
           I64[Sp - 24] = block_c18M_info;
           R1 = GHC.Show.$fShow[]_closure;
           P64[Sp - 32] = GHC.Show.$fShowChar_closure;
           Sp = Sp - 32;
           call stg_ap_p_fast(R1) args: 16, res: 8, upd: 24;
     }
 },
 _blk_c18M() { //  [R1]
         { info_tbls: [(c18M,
                        label: block_c18M_info
                        rep: StackRep []
                        srt: Just System.IO.print_closure)]
           stack_info: arg_space: 0
         }
     {offset
       c18M: // global
           _s16F::P64 = R1;
           R1 = System.IO.print_closure;
           P64[Sp] = _s16F::P64;
           call stg_ap_p_fast(R1) args: 32, res: 0, upd: 24;
     }
 },
```

In this example we have to lookup `//tick src<Main.hs:20:9-13>` for the return frame `c18M`.
Notice, that this cannot be done with the `Label` `c18M`, but with the `CLabel` `block_c18M_info`
(`label: block_c18M_info` is actually a `CLabel`).

Given a `CmmGraph`:
  - Check every `CmmBlock` from top (first) to bottom (last).
  - If a `CmmTick` holding a `SourceNote` is found, remember the source location in the tick.
  - If an assignment of the form `... = block_c18M_info;` (a `CmmStore` whose RHS is a
    `CmmLit (CmmLabel l)`) is found, map that label to the most recently visited source note's
    location.

See `labelsToSourcesSansTNTC` for the implementation of this algorithm.
