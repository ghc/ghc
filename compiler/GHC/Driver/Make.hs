--
-- Here "home module" means a module that doesn't come from another package.
--
-- For example, if GHC is invoked with modules "A" and "B" as targets,
-- but "A" imports some other module "C", then GHC will issue a warning
-- about module "C" not being listed in the command line.
--
-- The warning in enabled by `-Wmissing-home-modules`. See #13129

Note [Caching HomeModInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API clients who call `load` like to cache the HomeModInfo in memory between
calls to this function. In the old days, this cache was a simple MVar which stored
a HomePackageTable. This was insufficient, as the interface files for boot modules
were not recorded in the cache. In the less old days, the cache was returned at the
end of load, and supplied at the start of load, however, this was not sufficient
because it didn't account for the possibility of exceptions such as SIGINT (#20780).

So now, in the current day, we have this ModIfaceCache abstraction which
can incrementally be updated during the process of upsweep. This allows us
to store interface files for boot modules in an exception-safe way.

When the final version of an interface file is completed then it is placed into
the cache. The contents of the cache is retrieved, and the cache cleared, by iface_clearCache.

Note that because we only store the ModIface and Linkable in the ModIfaceCache,
hydration and rehydration is totally irrelevant, and we just store the CachedIface as
soon as it is completed.

{- Parallel Upsweep

The parallel upsweep attempts to concurrently compile the modules in the
compilation graph using multiple Haskell threads.

The Algorithm

* The list of `MakeAction`s are created by `interpretBuildPlan`. A `MakeAction` is
a pair of an `IO a` action and a `MVar a`, where to place the result.
  The list is sorted topologically, so can be executed in order without fear of
  blocking.
* runPipelines takes this list and eventually passes it to runLoop which executes
  each action and places the result into the right MVar.
* The amount of parallelism is controlled by a semaphore. This is just used around the
  module compilation step, so that only the right number of modules are compiled at
  the same time which reduces overall memory usage and allocations.
* Each proper node has a LogQueue, which dictates where to send it's output.
* The LogQueue is placed into the LogQueueQueue when the action starts and a worker
  thread processes the LogQueueQueue printing logs for each module in a stable order.
* The result variable for an action producing `a` is of type `Maybe a`, therefore
  it is still filled on a failure. If a module fails to compile, the
  failure is propagated through the whole module graph and any modules which didn't
  depend on the failure can still be compiled. This behaviour also makes the code
  quite a bit cleaner.

{-

Note [--make mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two main parts to `--make` mode.

1. `downsweep`: Starts from the top of the module graph and computes dependencies.
2. `upsweep`: Starts from the bottom of the module graph and compiles modules.

The result of the downsweep is a 'ModuleGraph', which is then passed to 'upsweep' which
computers how to build this ModuleGraph.

Note [Upsweep]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upsweep takes a 'ModuleGraph' as input, computes a build plan and then executes
the plan in order to compile the project.

The first step is computing the build plan from a 'ModuleGraph'.

The output of this step is a `[BuildPlan]`, which is a topologically sorted plan for
how to build all the modules.

```
data BuildPlan = SingleModule ModuleGraphNode  -- A simple, single module all alone but *might* have an hs-boot file which isn't part of a cycle
               | ResolvedCycle [Either ModuleGraphNode ModuleGraphNodeWithBoot]   -- A resolved cycle, linearised by hs-boot files
               | UnresolvedCycle [ModuleGraphNode] -- An actual cycle, which wasn't resolved by hs-boot files
```

The plan is computed in two steps:

Step 1:  Topologically sort the module graph without hs-boot files. This returns a [SCC ModuleGraphNode] which contains
         cycles.
Step 2:  For each cycle, topologically sort the modules in the cycle *with* the relevant hs-boot files. This should
         result in an acyclic build plan if the hs-boot files are sufficient to resolve the cycle.
Step 2a: For each module in the cycle, if the module has a boot file then compute the
         modules on the path between it and the hs-boot file.
         These are the intermediate modules which:
            (1) are (transitive) dependencies of the non-boot module, and
            (2) have the boot module as a (transitive) dependency.
         In particular, all such intermediate modules must appear in the same unit as
         the module under consideration, as module cycles cannot cross unit boundaries.
         This information is stored in ModuleGraphNodeWithBoot.

The `[BuildPlan]` is then interpreted by the `interpretBuildPlan` function.

* SingleModule nodes are compiled normally by either the upsweep_inst or upsweep_mod functions.
* ResolvedCycles need to compiled "together" so that modules outside the cycle are presented
  with a consistent knot-tied version of modules at the end.
    - When the ModuleGraphNodeWithBoot nodes are compiled then suitable rehydration
      is performed both before and after the module in question is compiled.
      See Note [Hydrating Modules] for more information.
* UnresolvedCycles are indicative of a proper cycle, unresolved by hs-boot files
  and are reported as an error to the user.

The main trickiness of `interpretBuildPlan` is deciding which version of a dependency
is visible from each module. For modules which are not in a cycle, there is just
one version of a module, so that is always used. For modules in a cycle, there are two versions of
'HomeModInfo'.

1. Internal to loop: The version created whilst compiling the loop by upsweep_mod.
2. External to loop: The knot-tied version created by typecheckLoop.

Whilst compiling a module inside the loop, we need to use the (1). For a module which
is outside of the loop which depends on something from in the loop, the (2) version
is used.

As the plan is interpreted, which version of a HomeModInfo is visible is updated
by updating a map held in a state monad. So after a loop has finished being compiled,
the visible module is the one created by typecheckLoop and the internal version is not
used again.

This plan also ensures the most important invariant to do with module loops:

> If you depend on anything within a module loop, before you can use the dependency,
  the whole loop has to finish compiling.

The end result of `interpretBuildPlan` is a `[MakeAction]`, which are pairs
of `IO a` actions and a `MVar (Maybe a)`, somewhere to put the result of running
the action. This list is topologically sorted, so can be run in order to compute
the whole graph.

As well as this `interpretBuildPlan` also outputs an `IO [Maybe (Maybe HomeModInfo)]` which
can be queried at the end to get the result of all modules at the end, with their proper
visibility. For example, if any module in a loop fails then all modules in that loop will
report as failed because the visible node at the end will be the result of checking
these modules together.

{- Note [-fno-code mode]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC offers the flag -fno-code for the purpose of parsing and typechecking a
program without generating object files. This is intended to be used by tooling
and IDEs to provide quick feedback on any parser or type errors as cheaply as
possible.

When GHC is invoked with -fno-code no object files or linked output will be
generated. As many errors and warnings as possible will be generated, as if
-fno-code had not been passed. The session DynFlags will have
backend == NoBackend.

-fwrite-interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whether interface files are generated in -fno-code mode is controlled by the
-fwrite-interface flag. The -fwrite-interface flag is a no-op if -fno-code is
not also passed. Recompilation avoidance requires interface files, so passing
-fno-code without -fwrite-interface should be avoided. If -fno-code were
re-implemented today, -fwrite-interface would be discarded and it would be
considered always on; this behaviour is as it is for backwards compatibility.

================================================================
IN SUMMARY: ALWAYS PASS -fno-code AND -fwrite-interface TOGETHER
================================================================

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A module using template haskell may invoke an imported function from inside a
splice. This will cause the type-checker to attempt to execute that code, which
would fail if no object files had been generated. See #8025. To rectify this,
during the downsweep we patch the DynFlags in the ModSummary of any home module
that is imported by a module that uses template haskell, to generate object
code.

The flavour of the generated code depends on whether `-fprefer-byte-code` is enabled
or not in the module which needs the code generation. If the module requires byte-code then
dependencies will generate byte-code, otherwise they will generate object files.
In the case where some modules require byte-code and some object files, both are
generated by enabling `-fbyte-code-and-object-code`, the test "fat015" tests these
configurations.

The object files (and interface files if -fwrite-interface is disabled) produced
for template haskell are written to temporary files.

Note that since template haskell can run arbitrary IO actions, -fno-code mode
is no more secure than running without it.

Potential TODOS:
~~~~~
* Remove -fwrite-interface and have interface files always written in -fno-code
  mode
* Both .o and .dyn_o files are generated for template haskell, but we only need
  .dyn_o. Fix it.
* In make mode, a message like
  Compiling A (A.hs, /tmp/ghc_123.o)
  is shown if downsweep enabled object code generation for A. Perhaps we should
  show "nothing" or "temporary object file" instead. Note that one
  can currently use -keep-tmp-files and inspect the generated file with the
  current behaviour.
* Offer a -no-codedir command line option, and write what were temporary
  object files there. This would speed up recompilation.
* Use existing object files (if they are up to date) instead of always
  generating temporary ones.

-- Note [When source is considered modified]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- A number of functions in GHC.Driver accept a SourceModified argument, which
-- is part of how GHC determines whether recompilation may be avoided (see the
-- definition of the SourceModified data type for details).
--
-- Determining whether or not a source file is considered modified depends not
-- only on the source file itself, but also on the output files which compiling
-- that module would produce. This is done because GHC supports a number of
-- flags which control which output files should be produced, e.g. -fno-code
-- -fwrite-interface and -fwrite-ide-file; we must check not only whether the
-- source file has been modified since the last compile, but also whether the
-- source file has been modified since the last compile which produced all of
-- the output files which have been requested.
--
-- Specifically, a source file is considered unmodified if it is up-to-date
-- relative to all of the output files which have been requested. Whether or
-- not an output file is up-to-date depends on what kind of file it is:
--
-- * iface (.hi) files are considered up-to-date if (and only if) their
--   mi_src_hash field matches the hash of the source file,
--
-- * all other output files (.o, .dyn_o, .hie, etc) are considered up-to-date
--   if (and only if) their modification times on the filesystem are greater
--   than or equal to the modification time of the corresponding .hi file.
--
-- Why do we use '>=' rather than '>' for output files other than the .hi file?
-- If the filesystem has poor resolution for timestamps (e.g. FAT32 has a
-- resolution of 2 seconds), we may often find that the .hi and .o files have
-- the same modification time. Using >= is slightly unsafe, but it matches
-- make's behaviour.
--
-- This strategy allows us to do the minimum work necessary in order to ensure
-- that all the files the user cares about are up-to-date; e.g. we should not
-- worry about .o files if the user has indicated that they are not interested
-- in them via -fno-code. See also #9243.
--
-- Note that recompilation avoidance is dependent on .hi files being produced,
-- which does not happen if -fno-write-interface -fno-code is passed. That is,
-- passing -fno-write-interface -fno-code means that you cannot benefit from
-- recompilation avoidance. See also Note [-fno-code mode].
--
-- The correctness of this strategy depends on an assumption that whenever we
-- are producing multiple output files, the .hi file is always written first.
-- If this assumption is violated, we risk recompiling unnecessarily by
-- incorrectly regarding non-.hi files as outdated.

Note [Hydrating Modules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are at least 4 different representations of an interface file as described
by this diagram.

------------------------------
|       On-disk M.hi         |
------------------------------
    |             ^
    | Read file   | Write file
    V             |
-------------------------------
|      ByteString             |
-------------------------------
    |             ^
    | Binary.get  | Binary.put
    V             |
--------------------------------
|    ModIface (an acyclic AST) |
--------------------------------
    |           ^
    | hydrate   | mkIfaceTc
    V           |
---------------------------------
|  ModDetails (lots of cycles)  |
---------------------------------

The last step, converting a ModIface into a ModDetails is known as "hydration".

Hydration happens in three different places

* When an interface file is initially loaded from disk, it has to be hydrated.
* When a module is finished compiling, we hydrate the ModIface in order to generate
  the version of ModDetails which exists in memory (see Note [ModDetails and --make mode])
* When dealing with boot files and module loops (see Note [Rehydrating Modules])

Note [Rehydrating Modules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a module has a boot file then it is critical to rehydrate the modules on
the path between the two (see #20561).

Suppose we have ("R" for "recursive"):
```
R.hs-boot:   module R where
               data T
               g :: T -> T

A.hs:        module A( f, T, g ) where
                import {-# SOURCE #-} R
                data S = MkS T
                f :: T -> S = ...g...

R.hs:        module R where
                import A
                data T = T1 | T2 S
                g = ...f...
```

== Why we need to rehydrate A's ModIface before compiling R.hs

After compiling A.hs we'll have a TypeEnv in which the Id for `f` has a type
that uses the AbstractTyCon T; and a TyCon for `S` that also mentions that same
AbstractTyCon. (Abstract because it came from R.hs-boot; we know nothing about
it.)

When compiling R.hs, we build a TyCon for `T`.  But that TyCon mentions `S`, and
it currently has an AbstractTyCon for `T` inside it.  But we want to build a
fully cyclic structure, in which `S` refers to `T` and `T` refers to `S`.

Solution: **rehydration**.  *Before compiling `R.hs`*, rehydrate all the
ModIfaces below it that depend on R.hs-boot.  To rehydrate a ModIface, call
`typecheckIface` to convert it to a ModDetails.  It's just a de-serialisation
step, no type inference, just lookups.

Now `S` will be bound to a thunk that, when forced, will "see" the final binding
for `T`; see [Tying the knot](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/tying-the-knot).
But note that this must be done *before* compiling R.hs.

== Why we need to rehydrate A's ModIface after compiling R.hs

When compiling R.hs, the knot-tying stuff above will ensure that `f`'s unfolding
mentions the `LocalId` for `g`.  But when we finish R, we carefully ensure that
all those `LocalIds` are turned into completed `GlobalIds`, replete with
unfoldings etc.   Alas, that will not apply to the occurrences of `g` in `f`'s
unfolding. And if we leave matters like that, they will stay that way, and *all*
subsequent modules that import A will see a crippled unfolding for `f`.

Solution: rehydrate both R and A's ModIface together, right after completing R.hs.

~~ Which modules to rehydrate

We only need rehydrate modules that are
* Below R.hs
* Above R.hs-boot

There might be many unrelated modules (in the home package) that don't need to be
rehydrated.

== Loops with multiple boot files

It is possible for a module graph to have a loop (SCC, when ignoring boot files)
which requires multiple boot files to break. In this case, we must perform
several hydration steps:
  1. The hydration steps described above, which are necessary for correctness.
  2. An extra hydration step at the end of compiling the entire SCC, in order to
     remove space leaks, as we explain below.

Consider the following example:

   ┌─────┐     ┌─────┐
   │  A  │     │  B  │
   └──┬──┘     └──┬──┘
      │           │
  ┌───▼───────────▼───┐
  │         C         │
  └───┬───────────┬───┘
      │           │
 ┌────▼───┐   ┌───▼────┐
 │ A-boot │   │ B-boot │
 └────────┘   └────────┘

A, B and C live together in a SCC. Suppose that we compile the modules in the
order:

  A-boot, B-boot, C, A, B.

When we come to compile A, we will perform the necessary hydration steps,
because A has a boot file. This means that C will be hydrated relative to A,
and the ModDetails for A will reference C/A. Then, when B is compiled,
C will be rehydrated again, and so B will reference C/A,B. At this point,
its interface will be hydrated relative to both A and B.
This causes a space leak: there are now two different copies of C's ModDetails,
kept alive by modules A and B. This is especially problematic if C is large.

The way to avoid this space leak is to rehydrate an entire SCC together at the
end of compilation, so that all the ModDetails point to interfaces for .hs files.
In this example, when we hydrate A, B and C together, then both A and B will refer to
C/A,B.

See #21900 for some more discussion.

== Modules "above" the loop

This dark corner is the subject of #14092.

Suppose we add to our example
```
X.hs     module X where
           import A
           data XT = MkX T
           fx = ...g...
```
If in `--make` we compile R.hs-boot, then A.hs, then X.hs, we'll get a `ModDetails` for `X` that has an AbstractTyCon for `T` in the argument type of `MkX`.  So:

* Either we should delay compiling X until after R has been compiled. (This is what we do)
* Or we should rehydrate X after compiling R -- because it transitively depends on R.hs-boot.

Ticket #20200 has exposed some issues to do with the knot-tying logic in GHC.Make, in `--make` mode.
#20200 has lots of issues, many of them now fixed;
this particular issue starts [here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20200#note_385758).

The wiki page [Tying the knot](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/tying-the-knot) is helpful.

{- Note [GHC Heap Invariants]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This note is a general place to explain some of the heap invariants which should
hold for a program compiled with --make mode. These invariants are all things
which can be checked easily using ghc-debug.

1. No HomeModInfo are reachable via the EPS.
   Why? Interfaces are lazily loaded into the EPS and the lazy thunk retains
        a reference to the entire HscEnv, if we are not careful the HscEnv will
        contain the HomePackageTable at the time the interface was loaded and
        it will never be released.
   Where? dontLeakTheHUG in GHC.Iface.Load

2. No KnotVars are live at the end of upsweep (#20491)
   Why? KnotVars contains an old stale reference to the TypeEnv for modules
        which participate in a loop. At the end of a loop all the KnotVars references
        should be removed by the call to typecheckLoop.
   Where? typecheckLoop in GHC.Driver.Make.

3. Immediately after a reload, no ModDetails are live.
   Why? During the upsweep all old ModDetails are replaced with a new ModDetails
        generated from a ModIface. If we don't clear the ModDetails before the
        reload takes place then memory usage during the reload is twice as much
        as it should be as we retain a copy of the ModDetails for too long.
   Where? pruneCache in GHC.Driver.Make

4. No TcGblEnv or TcLclEnv are live after typechecking is completed.
   Why? By the time we get to simplification all the data structures from typechecking
        should be eliminated.
   Where? No one place in the compiler. These leaks can be introduced by not suitable
          forcing functions which take a TcLclEnv as an argument.

5. At the end of a successful upsweep, the number of live ModDetails equals the
   number of non-boot Modules.
   Why? Each module has a HomeModInfo which contains a ModDetails from that module.
