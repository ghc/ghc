{\em Will wrote: What??? I thought the idea was to float as far
inwards as possible, no matter what.  This is dropping all bindings
every time it sees a lambda of any kind.  Help! }

You are assuming we DO DO full laziness AFTER floating inwards!  We
have to [not float inside lambdas] if we don't.

If we indeed do full laziness after the floating inwards (we could
check the compilation flags for that) then I agree we could be more
aggressive and do float inwards past lambdas.

Actually we are not doing a proper full laziness (see below), which
was another reason for not floating inwards past a lambda.

This can easily be fixed.  The problem is that we float lets outwards,
but there are a few expressions which are not let bound, like case
scrutinees and case alternatives.  After floating inwards the
simplifier could decide to inline the let and the laziness would be
lost, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
let a = expensive             ==> \b -> case expensive of ...
in \ b -> case a of ...
\end{verbatim}
The fix is
\begin{enumerate}
\item
to let bind the algebraic case scrutinees (done, I think) and
the case alternatives (except the ones with an
unboxed type)(not done, I think). This is best done in the
GHC.Core.Opt.SetLevels module, which tags things with their level numbers.
\item
do the full laziness pass (floating lets outwards).
\item
simplify. The simplifier inlines the (trivial) lets that were
 created but were not floated outwards.
\end{enumerate}

With the fix I think Will's suggestion that we can gain even more from
strictness by floating inwards past lambdas makes sense.

We still gain even without going past lambdas, as things may be
strict in the (new) context of a branch (where it was floated to) or
of a let rhs, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
let a = something            case x of
in case x of                   alt1 -> case something of a -> a + a
     alt1 -> a + a      ==>    alt2 -> b
     alt2 -> b

let a = something           let b = case something of a -> a + a
in let b = a + a        ==> in (b,b)
in (b,b)
\end{verbatim}
Also, even if a is not found to be strict in the new context and is
still left as a let, if the branch is not taken (or b is not entered)
the closure for a is not built.

{- Note [Dead bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At a literal we won't usually have any floated bindings; the
only way that can happen is if the binding wrapped the literal
/in the original input program/.  e.g.
   case x of { DEFAULT -> 1# }
But, while this may be unusual it is not actually wrong, and it did
once happen (#15696).

Note [Join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally, we don't need to worry about join points - there are places we're
not allowed to float them, but since they can't have occurrences in those
places, we're not tempted.

We do need to be careful about jumps, however:

  joinrec j x y z = ... in
  jump j a b c

Previous versions often floated the definition of a recursive function into its
only non-recursive occurrence. But for a join point, this is a disaster:

  (joinrec j x y z = ... in
  jump j) a b c -- wrong!

Every jump must be exact, so the jump to j must have three arguments. Hence
we're careful not to float into the target of a jump (though we can float into
the arguments just fine).

Floating in can /enhance/ join points.  Consider this (#3458)
    f2 x = let g :: Int -> Int
               g y = if y==0 then y+x else g (y-1)
           in case g x of
                0 -> True
                _ -> False

Here `g` is not a join point. But if we float inwards it becomes one!  We
float in; the occurrence analyser identifies `g` as a join point; the Simplifier
retains that property, so we get
    f2 x = case (joinrec
                    g y = if y==0 then y+x else g (y-1)
                 in jump g x) of
              0 -> True
              _ -> False

Now that outer case gets pushed into the RHS of the joinrec, giving
    f2 x = joinrec g y = if y==0
                         then case y+x of { 0 -> True; _ -> False }
                         else jump g (y-1)
           in jump g x
Nice!

Note [Floating in past a lambda group]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We must be careful about floating inside a value lambda.
  That risks losing laziness.
  The float-out pass might rescue us, but then again it might not.

* We must be careful about type lambdas too.  At one time we did, and
  there is no risk of duplicating work thereby, but we do need to be
  careful.  In particular, here is a bad case (it happened in the
  cichelli benchmark:
        let v = ...
        in let f = /\t -> \a -> ...
           ==>
        let f = /\t -> let v = ... in \a -> ...
  This is bad as now f is an updatable closure (update PAP)
  and has arity 0.

* Hack alert!  We only float in through one-shot lambdas,
  not (as you might guess) through lone big lambdas.
  Reason: we float *out* past big lambdas (see the test in the Lam
  case of FloatOut.floatExpr) and we don't want to float straight
  back in again.

  It *is* important to float into one-shot lambdas, however;
  see the remarks with noFloatIntoRhs.

So we treat lambda in groups, using the following rule:

 Float in if (a) there is at least one Id,
         and (b) there are no non-one-shot Ids

 Otherwise drop all the bindings outside the group.

This is what the 'go' function in the AnnLam case is doing.

(Join points are handled similarly: a join point is considered one-shot iff
it's non-recursive, so we float only into non-recursive join points.)

Urk! if all are tyvars, and we don't float in, we may miss an
      opportunity to float inside a nested case branch

Note [Floating coercions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We could, in principle, have a coercion binding like
   case f x of co { DEFAULT -> e1 e2 }
It's not common to have a function that returns a coercion, but nothing
in Core prohibits it.  If so, 'co' might be mentioned in e1 or e2
/only in a type/.  E.g. suppose e1 was
  let (x :: Int |> co) = blah in blah2


But, with coercions appearing in types, there is a complication: we
might be floating in a "strict let" -- that is, a case. Case expressions
mention their return type. We absolutely can't float a coercion binding
inward to the point that the type of the expression it's about to wrap
mentions the coercion. So we include the union of the sets of free variables
of the types of all the drop points involved. If any of the floaters
bind a coercion variable mentioned in any of the types, that binder must
be dropped right away.

Note [Shadowing and name capture]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have
    let x = y+1 in
    case p of
       (y:ys) -> ...x...
       [] -> blah
It is obviously bogus for FloatIn to transform to
    case p of
       (y:ys) -> ...(let x = y+1 in x)...
       [] -> blah
because the y is captured.  This doesn't happen much, because shadowing is
rare (see Note [Shadowing in Core]), but it did happen in #22662.

One solution would be to clone as we go.  But a simpler one is this:

  at a binding site (like that for (y:ys) above), abandon float-in for
  any floating bindings that mention the binders (y, ys in this case)

We achieve that by calling sepBindsByDropPoint with the binders in
the "used-here" set:

* In fiExpr (AnnLam ...).  For the body there is no need to delete
  the lambda-binders from the body_fvs, because any bindings that
  mention these binders will be dropped here anyway.

* In fiExpr (AnnCase ...). Remember to include the case_bndr in the
  binders.  Again, no need to delete the alt binders from the rhs
  free vars, because any bindings mentioning them will be dropped
  here unconditionally.

{-
For @Lets@, the possible ``drop points'' for the \tr{to_drop}
bindings are: (a)~in the body, (b1)~in the RHS of a NonRec binding,
or~(b2), in each of the RHSs of the pairs of a @Rec@.

Note that we do {\em weird things} with this let's binding.  Consider:
\begin{verbatim}
let
    w = ...
in {
    let v = ... w ...
    in ... v .. w ...
}
\end{verbatim}
Look at the inner \tr{let}.  As \tr{w} is used in both the bind and
body of the inner let, we could panic and leave \tr{w}'s binding where
it is.  But \tr{v} is floatable further into the body of the inner let, and
{\em then} \tr{w} will also be only in the body of that inner let.

So: rather than drop \tr{w}'s binding here, we add it onto the list of
things to drop in the outer let's body, and let nature take its
course.

Note [extra_fvs (1)]: avoid floating into RHS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider let x=\y....t... in body.  We do not necessarily want to float
a binding for t into the RHS, because it'll immediately be floated out
again.  (It won't go inside the lambda else we risk losing work.)
In letrec, we need to be more careful still. We don't want to transform
        let x# = y# +# 1#
        in
        letrec f = \z. ...x#...f...
        in ...
into
        letrec f = let x# = y# +# 1# in \z. ...x#...f... in ...
because now we can't float the let out again, because a letrec
can't have unboxed bindings.

So we make "extra_fvs" which is the rhs_fvs of such bindings, and
arrange to dump bindings that bind extra_fvs before the entire let.

Note [extra_fvs (2)]: free variables of rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  let x{rule mentioning y} = rhs in body
Here y is not free in rhs or body; but we still want to dump bindings
that bind y outside the let.  So we augment extra_fvs with the
idRuleAndUnfoldingVars of x.  No need for type variables, hence not using
idFreeVars.

{- Note [Floating primops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We try to float-in a case expression over an unlifted type.  The
motivating example was #5658: in particular, this change allows
array indexing operations, which have a single DEFAULT alternative
without any binders, to be floated inward.

In particular, we want to be able to transform

  case indexIntArray# arr i of vi {
    __DEFAULT -> case <# j n of _ {
      __DEFAULT -> False
      1# -> case indexIntArray# arr j of vj {
        __DEFAULT -> ... vi ... vj ...
      }
    }
  }

by floating in `indexIntArray# arr i` to produce

  case <# j n of _ {
    __DEFAULT -> False
    1# -> case indexIntArray# arr i of vi {
      __DEFAULT -> case indexIntArray# arr j of vj {
        __DEFAULT -> ... vi ... vj ...
      }
    }
  }

...which skips the `indexIntArray# arr i` call entirely in the out-of-bounds branch.

SIMD primops for unpacking SIMD vectors into an unboxed tuple of unboxed
scalars also need to be floated inward, but unpacks have a single non-DEFAULT
alternative that binds the elements of the tuple. We now therefore also support
floating in cases with a single alternative that may bind values.

But there are wrinkles

* Which unlifted cases do we float?
  See Note [Transformations affected by primop effects] in GHC.Builtin.PrimOps
  which explains:
   - We can float in or discard CanFail primops, but we can't float them out.
   - We don't want to discard a synchronous exception or side effect
     so we don't float those at all. Hence exprOkToDiscard.
   - Throwing precise exceptions is a special case of the previous point: We
     may /never/ float in a call to (something that ultimately calls)
     'raiseIO#'.
     See Note [Precise exceptions and strictness analysis] in GHC.Types.Demand.

* Because we can float can-fail primops (array indexing, division) inwards
  but not outwards, we must be careful not to transform
     case a /# b of r -> f (F# r)
  ===>
    f (case a /# b of r -> F# r)
  because that creates a new thunk that wasn't there before.  And
  because it can't be floated out (CanFail), the thunk will stay
  there.  Disaster!  (This happened in nofib 'simple' and 'scs'.)

  Solution: only float cases into the branches of other cases, and
  not into the arguments of an application, or the RHS of a let. This
  is somewhat conservative, but it's simple.  And it still hits the
  cases like #5658.   This is implemented in sepBindsByJoinPoint;
  if is_case is False we dump all floating cases right here.

* #14511 is another example of why we want to restrict float-in
  of case-expressions.  Consider
     case indexArray# a n of (# r #) -> writeArray# ma i (f r)
  Now, floating that indexing operation into the (f r) thunk will
  not create any new thunks, but it will keep the array 'a' alive
  for much longer than the programmer expected.

  So again, not floating a case into a let or argument seems like
  the Right Thing

For @Case@, the possible drop points for the 'to_drop'
bindings are:
  (a) inside the scrutinee
  (b) inside one of the alternatives/default (default FVs always /first/!).

Note [Don't float in type or coercion lets]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't float type-lets or coercion-lets inward. Doing so does not
save allocation; and if we did we't have to be careful of the variables
mentioned in the idType of the case-binder.  For example
    \(x :: Maybe b) -> let a = Maybe b in
                       case x of (cb :: a) of { Just y -> ... }
We must not float the `a = Maybe b` into the case alternatives, because
it is mentioned in the type of `cb`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When do we want to float bindings into
   - noFloatIntoRhs: the RHS of a let-binding
   - noFloatIntoArg: the argument of a function application

Definitely don't float into RHS if it has unlifted type;
that would destroy the let-can-float invariant.

* Wrinkle 1: do not float in if
     (a) any non-one-shot value lambdas
  or (b) all type lambdas
  In both cases we'll float straight back out again
  NB: Must line up with fiExpr (AnnLam...); see #7088

  (a) is important: we /must/ float into a one-shot lambda group
  (which includes join points). This makes a big difference
  for things like
     f x# = let x = I# x#
            in let j = \() -> ...x...
               in if <condition> then normal-path else j ()
  If x is used only in the error case join point, j, we must float the
  boxing constructor into it, else we box it every time which is very
  bad news indeed.

* Wrinkle 2: for RHSs, do not float into a HNF; we'll just float right
  back out again... not tragic, but a waste of time.

  For function arguments we will still end up with this
  in-then-out stuff; consider
    letrec x = e in f x
  Here x is not a HNF, so we'll produce
    f (letrec x = e in x)
  which is OK... it's not that common, and we'll end up
  floating out again, in CorePrep if not earlier.
  Still, we use exprIsTrivial to catch this case (sigh)


************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
\subsection{@sepBindsByDropPoint@}
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

This is the crucial function.  The idea is: We have a wad of bindings
that we'd like to distribute inside a collection of {\em drop points};
insides the alternatives of a \tr{case} would be one example of some
drop points; the RHS and body of a non-recursive \tr{let} binding
would be another (2-element) collection.

So: We're given a list of sets-of-free-variables, one per drop point,
and a list of floating-inwards bindings.  If a binding can go into
only one drop point (without suddenly making something out-of-scope),
in it goes.  If a binding is used inside {\em multiple} drop points,
then it has to go in a you-must-drop-it-above-all-these-drop-points
point.

We have to maintain the order on these drop-point-related lists.

{- Note [Duplicating floats]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For case expressions we duplicate the binding if it is reasonably
small, and if it is not used in all the RHSs This is good for
situations like
     let x = I# y in
     case e of
       C -> error x
       D -> error x
       E -> ...not mentioning x...

If the thing is used in all RHSs there is nothing gained,
so we don't duplicate then.
