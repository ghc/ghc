************************************************************************

These notes describe how we implement specialisation to eliminate
overloading.

The specialisation pass works on Core
syntax, complete with all the explicit dictionary application,
abstraction and construction as added by the type checker.  The
existing type checker remains largely as it is.

One important thought: the {\em types} passed to an overloaded
function, and the {\em dictionaries} passed are mutually redundant.
If the same function is applied to the same type(s) then it is sure to
be applied to the same dictionary(s)---or rather to the same {\em
values}.  (The arguments might look different but they will evaluate
to the same value.)

Second important thought: we know that we can make progress by
treating dictionary arguments as static and worth specialising on.  So
we can do without binding-time analysis, and instead specialise on
dictionary arguments and no others.

The basic idea
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

        let f = <f_rhs>
        in <body>

and suppose f is overloaded.

STEP 1: CALL-INSTANCE COLLECTION

We traverse <body>, accumulating all applications of f to types and
dictionaries.

(Might there be partial applications, to just some of its types and
dictionaries?  In principle yes, but in practice the type checker only
builds applications of f to all its types and dictionaries, so partial
applications could only arise as a result of transformation, and even
then I think it's unlikely.  In any case, we simply don't accumulate such
partial applications.)


STEP 2: EQUIVALENCES

So now we have a collection of calls to f:
        f t1 t2 d1 d2
        f t3 t4 d3 d4
        ...
Notice that f may take several type arguments.  To avoid ambiguity, we
say that f is called at type t1/t2 and t3/t4.

We take equivalence classes using equality of the *types* (ignoring
the dictionary args, which as mentioned previously are redundant).

STEP 3: SPECIALISATION

For each equivalence class, choose a representative (f t1 t2 d1 d2),
and create a local instance of f, defined thus:

        f@t1/t2 = <f_rhs> t1 t2 d1 d2

f_rhs presumably has some big lambdas and dictionary lambdas, so lots
of simplification will now result.  However we don't actually *do* that
simplification.  Rather, we leave it for the simplifier to do.  If we
*did* do it, though, we'd get more call instances from the specialised
RHS.  We can work out what they are by instantiating the call-instance
set from f's RHS with the types t1, t2.

Add this new id to f's IdInfo, to record that f has a specialised version.

Before doing any of this, check that f's IdInfo doesn't already
tell us about an existing instance of f at the required type/s.
(This might happen if specialisation was applied more than once, or
it might arise from user SPECIALIZE pragmas.)

Recursion
~~~~~~~~~
Wait a minute!  What if f is recursive?  Then we can't just plug in
its right-hand side, can we?

But it's ok.  The type checker *always* creates non-recursive definitions
for overloaded recursive functions.  For example:

        f x = f (x+x)           -- Yes I know its silly

becomes

        f a (d::Num a) = let p = +.sel a d
                         in
                         letrec fl (y::a) = fl (p y y)
                         in
                         fl

We still have recursion for non-overloaded functions which we
specialise, but the recursive call should get specialised to the
same recursive version.


Polymorphism 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All this is crystal clear when the function is applied to *constant
types*; that is, types which have no type variables inside.  But what if
it is applied to non-constant types?  Suppose we find a call of f at type
t1/t2.  There are two possibilities:

(a) The free type variables of t1, t2 are in scope at the definition point
of f.  In this case there's no problem, we proceed just as before.  A common
example is as follows.  Here's the Haskell:

        g y = let f x = x+x
              in f y + f y

After typechecking we have

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let f b (d'::Num b) (x::b) = +.sel b d' x x
                                in +.sel a d (f a d y) (f a d y)

Notice that the call to f is at type type "a"; a non-constant type.
Both calls to f are at the same type, so we can specialise to give:

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let f@a (x::a) = +.sel a d x x
                                in +.sel a d (f@a y) (f@a y)


(b) The other case is when the type variables in the instance types
are *not* in scope at the definition point of f.  The example we are
working with above is a good case.  There are two instances of (+.sel a d),
but "a" is not in scope at the definition of +.sel.  Can we do anything?
Yes, we can "common them up", a sort of limited common sub-expression deal.
This would give:

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let +.sel@a = +.sel a d
                                    f@a (x::a) = +.sel@a x x
                                in +.sel@a (f@a y) (f@a y)

This can save work, and can't be spotted by the type checker, because
the two instances of +.sel weren't originally at the same type.

Further notes on (b)

* There are quite a few variations here.  For example, the defn of
  +.sel could be floated outside the \y, to attempt to gain laziness.
  It certainly mustn't be floated outside the \d because the d has to
  be in scope too.

* We don't want to inline f_rhs in this case, because
that will duplicate code.  Just commoning up the call is the point.

* Nothing gets added to +.sel's IdInfo.

* Don't bother unless the equivalence class has more than one item!

Not clear whether this is all worth it.  It is of course OK to
simply discard call-instances when passing a big lambda.

Polymorphism 2 -- Overloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a function whose most general type is

        f :: forall a b. Ord a => [a] -> b -> b

There is really no point in making a version of g at Int/Int and another
at Int/Bool, because it's only instantiating the type variable "a" which
buys us any efficiency. Since g is completely polymorphic in b there
ain't much point in making separate versions of g for the different
b types.

That suggests that we should identify which of g's type variables
are constrained (like "a") and which are unconstrained (like "b").
Then when taking equivalence classes in STEP 2, we ignore the type args
corresponding to unconstrained type variable.  In STEP 3 we make
polymorphic versions.  Thus:

        f@t1/ = /\b -> <f_rhs> t1 b d1 d2

We do this.


Dictionary floating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this

        f a (d::Num a) = let g = ...
                         in
                         ...(let d1::Ord a = Num.Ord.sel a d in g a d1)...

Here, g is only called at one type, but the dictionary isn't in scope at the
definition point for g.  Usually the type checker would build a
definition for d1 which enclosed g, but the transformation system
might have moved d1's defn inward.  Solution: float dictionary bindings
outwards along with call instances.

Consider

        f x = let g p q = p==q
                  h r s = (r+s, g r s)
              in
              h x x


Before specialisation, leaving out type abstractions we have

        f df x = let g :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
                     g dg p q = == dg p q
                     h :: Num a => a -> a -> (a, Bool)
                     h dh r s = let deq = eqFromNum dh
                                in (+ dh r s, g deq r s)
              in
              h df x x

After specialising h we get a specialised version of h, like this:

                    h' r s = let deq = eqFromNum df
                             in (+ df r s, g deq r s)

But we can't naively make an instance for g from this, because deq is not in scope
at the defn of g.  Instead, we have to float out the (new) defn of deq
to widen its scope.  Notice that this floating can't be done in advance -- it only
shows up when specialisation is done.

User SPECIALIZE pragmas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specialisation pragmas can be digested by the type checker, and implemented
by adding extra definitions along with that of f, in the same way as before

        f@t1/t2 = <f_rhs> t1 t2 d1 d2

Indeed the pragmas *have* to be dealt with by the type checker, because
only it knows how to build the dictionaries d1 and d2!  For example

        g :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
        {-# SPECIALIZE f :: [Tree Int] -> [Tree Int] #-}

Here, the specialised version of g is an application of g's rhs to the
Ord dictionary for (Tree Int), which only the type checker can conjure
up.  There might not even *be* one, if (Tree Int) is not an instance of
Ord!  (All the other specialision has suitable dictionaries to hand
from actual calls.)

Problem.  The type checker doesn't have to hand a convenient <f_rhs>, because
it is buried in a complex (as-yet-un-desugared) binding group.
Maybe we should say

        f@t1/t2 = f* t1 t2 d1 d2

where f* is the Id f with an IdInfo which says "inline me regardless!".
Indeed all the specialisation could be done in this way.
That in turn means that the simplifier has to be prepared to inline absolutely
any in-scope let-bound thing.


Again, the pragma should permit polymorphism in unconstrained variables:

        h :: Ord a => [a] -> b -> b
        {-# SPECIALIZE h :: [Int] -> b -> b #-}

We *insist* that all overloaded type variables are specialised to ground types,
(and hence there can be no context inside a SPECIALIZE pragma).
We *permit* unconstrained type variables to be specialised to
        - a ground type
        - or left as a polymorphic type variable
but nothing in between.  So

        {-# SPECIALIZE h :: [Int] -> [c] -> [c] #-}

is *illegal*.  (It can be handled, but it adds complication, and gains the
programmer nothing.)


SPECIALISING INSTANCE DECLARATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

        instance Foo a => Foo [a] where
                ...
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo [Int] #-}

The original instance decl creates a dictionary-function
definition:

        dfun.Foo.List :: forall a. Foo a -> Foo [a]

The SPECIALIZE pragma just makes a specialised copy, just as for
ordinary function definitions:

        dfun.Foo.List@Int :: Foo [Int]
        dfun.Foo.List@Int = dfun.Foo.List Int dFooInt

The information about what instance of the dfun exist gets added to
the dfun's IdInfo in the same way as a user-defined function too.


Automatic instance decl specialisation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can instance decls be specialised automatically?  It's tricky.
We could collect call-instance information for each dfun, but
then when we specialised their bodies we'd get new call-instances
for ordinary functions; and when we specialised their bodies, we might get
new call-instances of the dfuns, and so on.  This all arises because of
the unrestricted mutual recursion between instance decls and value decls.

Still, there's no actual problem; it just means that we may not do all
the specialisation we could theoretically do.

Furthermore, instance decls are usually exported and used non-locally,
so we'll want to compile enough to get those specialisations done.

Lastly, there's no such thing as a local instance decl, so we can
survive solely by spitting out *usage* information, and then reading that
back in as a pragma when next compiling the file.  So for now,
we only specialise instance decls in response to pragmas.


SPITTING OUT USAGE INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To spit out usage information we need to traverse the code collecting
call-instance information for all imported (non-prelude?) functions
and data types. Then we equivalence-class it and spit it out.

This is done at the top-level when all the call instances which escape
must be for imported functions and data types.

*** Not currently done ***


Partial specialisation by pragmas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What about partial specialisation:

        k :: (Ord a, Eq b) => [a] -> b -> b -> [a]
        {-# SPECIALIZE k :: Eq b => [Int] -> b -> b -> [a] #-}

or even

        {-# SPECIALIZE k :: Eq b => [Int] -> [b] -> [b] -> [a] #-}

Seems quite reasonable.  Similar things could be done with instance decls:

        instance (Foo a, Foo b) => Foo (a,b) where
                ...
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo a => Foo (a,Int) #-}
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo b => Foo (Int,b) #-}

Ho hum.  Things are complex enough without this.  I pass.


Requirements for the simplifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simplifier has to be able to take advantage of the specialisation.

* When the simplifier finds an application of a polymorphic f, it looks in
f's IdInfo in case there is a suitable instance to call instead.  This converts

        f t1 t2 d1 d2   ===>   f_t1_t2

Note that the dictionaries get eaten up too!

* Dictionary selection operations on constant dictionaries must be
  short-circuited:

        +.sel Int d     ===>  +Int

The obvious way to do this is in the same way as other specialised
calls: +.sel has inside it some IdInfo which tells that if it's applied
to the type Int then it should eat a dictionary and transform to +Int.

In short, dictionary selectors need IdInfo inside them for constant
methods.

* Exactly the same applies if a superclass dictionary is being
  extracted:

        Eq.sel Int d   ===>   dEqInt

* Something similar applies to dictionary construction too.  Suppose
dfun.Eq.List is the function taking a dictionary for (Eq a) to
one for (Eq [a]).  Then we want

        dfun.Eq.List Int d      ===> dEq.List_Int

Where does the Eq [Int] dictionary come from?  It is built in
response to a SPECIALIZE pragma on the Eq [a] instance decl.

In short, dfun Ids need IdInfo with a specialisation for each
constant instance of their instance declaration.

All this uses a single mechanism: the SpecEnv inside an Id


What does the specialisation IdInfo look like?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SpecEnv of an Id maps a list of types (the template) to an expression

        [Type]  |->  Expr

For example, if f has this RuleInfo:

        [Int, a]  ->  \d:Ord Int. f' a

it means that we can replace the call

        f Int t  ===>  (\d. f' t)

This chucks one dictionary away and proceeds with the
specialised version of f, namely f'.


What can't be done this way?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no way, post-typechecker, to get a dictionary for (say)
Eq a from a dictionary for Eq [a].  So if we find

        ==.sel [t] d

we can't transform to

        eqList (==.sel t d')

where
        eqList :: (a->a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a] -> Bool

Of course, we currently have no way to automatically derive
eqList, nor to connect it to the Eq [a] instance decl, but you
can imagine that it might somehow be possible.  Taking advantage
of this is permanently ruled out.

Still, this is no great hardship, because we intend to eliminate
overloading altogether anyway!

A note about non-tyvar dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Ids have types like

        forall a,b,c. Eq a -> Ord [a] -> tau

This seems curious at first, because we usually only have dictionary
args whose types are of the form (C a) where a is a type variable.
But this doesn't hold for the functions arising from instance decls,
which sometimes get arguments with types of form (C (T a)) for some
type constructor T.

Should we specialise wrt this compound-type dictionary?  We used to say
"no", saying:
        "This is a heuristic judgement, as indeed is the fact that we
        specialise wrt only dictionaries.  We choose *not* to specialise
        wrt compound dictionaries because at the moment the only place
        they show up is in instance decls, where they are simply plugged
        into a returned dictionary.  So nothing is gained by specialising
        wrt them."

But it is simpler and more uniform to specialise wrt these dicts too;
and in future GHC is likely to support full fledged type signatures
like
        f :: Eq [(a,b)] => ...


************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
\subsubsection{The new specialiser}
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

Our basic game plan is this.  For let(rec) bound function
        f :: (C a, D c) => (a,b,c,d) -> Bool

* Find any specialised calls of f, (f ts ds), where
  ts are the type arguments t1 .. t4, and
  ds are the dictionary arguments d1 .. d2.

* Add a new definition for f1 (say):

        f1 = /\ b d -> (..body of f..) t1 b t3 d d1 d2

  Note that we abstract over the unconstrained type arguments.

* Add the mapping

        [t1,b,t3,d]  |->  \d1 d2 -> f1 b d

  to the specialisations of f.  This will be used by the
  simplifier to replace calls
                (f t1 t2 t3 t4) da db
  by
                (\d1 d1 -> f1 t2 t4) da db

  All the stuff about how many dictionaries to discard, and what types
  to apply the specialised function to, are handled by the fact that the
  SpecEnv contains a template for the result of the specialisation.

We don't build *partial* specialisations for f.  For example:

  f :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
  {-# SPECIALISE f :: (Eq b, Eq c) => (b,c) -> (b,c) -> Bool #-}

Here, little is gained by making a specialised copy of f.
There's a distinct danger that the specialised version would
first build a dictionary for (Eq b, Eq c), and then select the (==)
method from it!  Even if it didn't, not a great deal is saved.

We do, however, generate polymorphic, but not overloaded, specialisations:

  f :: Eq a => [a] -> b -> b -> b
  ... SPECIALISE f :: [Int] -> b -> b -> b ...

Hence, the invariant is this:

        *** no specialised version is overloaded ***

Note [Wrap bindings returned by specImports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'specImports' returns a set of specialized bindings. However, these are lacking
necessary floated dictionary bindings, which are returned by
UsageDetails(ud_binds). These dictionaries need to be brought into scope with
'wrapDictBinds' before the bindings returned by 'specImports' can be used. See,
for instance, the 'specImports' call in 'specProgram'.


Note [Disabling cross-module specialisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since GHC 7.10 we have performed specialisation of INLINABLE bindings living
in modules outside of the current module. This can sometimes uncover user code
which explodes in size when aggressively optimized. The
-fno-cross-module-specialise option was introduced to allow users to being
bitten by such instances to revert to the pre-7.10 behavior.

{- Note [Avoiding loops in specImports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must take great care when specialising instance declarations
(functions like $fOrdList) lest we accidentally build a recursive
dictionary. See Note [Avoiding loops].

The basic strategy of Note [Avoiding loops] is to use filterCalls
to discard loopy specialisations.  But to do that we must ensure
that the in-scope dict-binds (passed to filterCalls) contains
all the needed dictionary bindings.  In particular, in the recursive
call to spec_imorpts in spec_import, we must include the dict-binds
from the parent.  Lacking this caused #17151, a really nasty bug.

Here is what happened.
* Class struture:
    Source is a superclass of Mut
    Index is a superclass of Source

* We started with these dict binds
    dSource = $fSourcePix @Int $fIndexInt
    dIndex  = sc_sel dSource
    dMut    = $fMutPix @Int dIndex
  and these calls to specialise
    $fMutPix @Int dIndex
    $fSourcePix @Int $fIndexInt

* We specialised the call ($fMutPix @Int dIndex)
  ==> new call ($fSourcePix @Int dIndex)
      (because Source is a superclass of Mut)

* We specialised ($fSourcePix @Int dIndex)
  ==> produces specialised dict $s$fSourcePix,
      a record with dIndex as a field
      plus RULE forall d. ($fSourcePix @Int d) = $s$fSourcePix
  *** This is the bogus step ***

* Now we decide not to specialise the call
    $fSourcePix @Int $fIndexInt
  because we alredy have a RULE that matches it

* Finally the simplifer rewrites
    dSource = $fSourcePix @Int $fIndexInt
    ==>  dSource = $s$fSourcePix

Disaster. Now we have

Rewrite dSource's RHS to $s$fSourcePix   Disaster
    dSource = $s$fSourcePix
    dIndex  = sc_sel dSource
    $s$fSourcePix = MkSource dIndex ...

Solution: filterCalls should have stopped the bogus step,
by seeing that dIndex transitively uses $fSourcePix. But
it can only do that if it sees all the dict_binds.  Wow.

--------------
Here's another example (#13429).  Suppose we have
  class Monoid v => C v a where ...

We start with a call
   f @ [Integer] @ Integer $fC[]Integer

Specialising call to 'f' gives dict bindings
   $dMonoid_1 :: Monoid [Integer]
   $dMonoid_1 = M.$p1C @ [Integer] $fC[]Integer

   $dC_1 :: C [Integer] (Node [Integer] Integer)
   $dC_1 = M.$fCvNode @ [Integer] $dMonoid_1

...plus a recursive call to
   f @ [Integer] @ (Node [Integer] Integer) $dC_1

Specialising that call gives
   $dMonoid_2  :: Monoid [Integer]
   $dMonoid_2  = M.$p1C @ [Integer] $dC_1

   $dC_2 :: C [Integer] (Node [Integer] Integer)
   $dC_2 = M.$fCvNode @ [Integer] $dMonoid_2

Now we have two calls to the imported function
  M.$fCvNode :: Monoid v => C v a
  M.$fCvNode @v @a m = C m some_fun

But we must /not/ use the call (M.$fCvNode @ [Integer] $dMonoid_2)
for specialisation, else we get:

  $dC_1 = M.$fCvNode @ [Integer] $dMonoid_1
  $dMonoid_2 = M.$p1C @ [Integer] $dC_1
  $s$fCvNode = C $dMonoid_2 ...
    RULE M.$fCvNode [Integer] _ _ = $s$fCvNode

Now use the rule to rewrite the call in the RHS of $dC_1
and we get a loop!


Note [specImport call stack]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When specialising an imports function 'f', we may get new calls
of an imported fuction 'g', which we want to specialise in turn,
and similarly specialising 'g' might expose a new call to 'h'.

We track the stack of enclosing functions. So when specialising 'h' we
haev a specImport call stack of [g,f]. We do this for two reasons:
* Note [Warning about missed specialisations]
* Note [Avoiding recursive specialisation]

Note [Warning about missed specialisations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose
 * In module Lib, you carefully mark a function 'foo' INLINABLE
 * Import Lib(foo) into another module M
 * Call 'foo' at some specialised type in M
Then you jolly well expect it to be specialised in M.  But what if
'foo' calls another function 'Lib.bar'.  Then you'd like 'bar' to be
specialised too.  But if 'bar' is not marked INLINABLE it may well
not be specialised.  The warning Opt_WarnMissedSpecs warns about this.

It's more noisy to warning about a missed specialisation opportunity
for /every/ overloaded imported function, but sometimes useful. That
is what Opt_WarnAllMissedSpecs does.

ToDo: warn about missed opportunities for local functions.

Note [Avoiding recursive specialisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we specialise 'f' we may find new overloaded calls to 'g', 'h' in
'f's RHS.  So we want to specialise g,h.  But we don't want to
specialise f any more!  It's possible that f's RHS might have a
recursive yet-more-specialised call, so we'd diverge in that case.
And if the call is to the same type, one specialisation is enough.
Avoiding this recursive specialisation loop is one reason for the
'callers' stack passed to specImports and specImport.

Note [Specialise imported INLINABLE things]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What imported functions do we specialise?  The basic set is
 * DFuns and things with INLINABLE pragmas.
but with -fspecialise-aggressively we add
 * Anything with an unfolding template

#8874 has a good example of why we want to auto-specialise DFuns.

We have the -fspecialise-aggressively flag (usually off), because we
risk lots of orphan modules from over-vigorous specialisation.
However it's not a big deal: anything non-recursive with an
unfolding-template will probably have been inlined already.

Note [Glom the bindings if imported functions are specialised]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have an imported, *recursive*, INLINABLE function
   f :: Eq a => a -> a
   f = /\a \d x. ...(f a d)...
In the module being compiled we have
   g x = f (x::Int)
Now we'll make a specialised function
   f_spec :: Int -> Int
   f_spec = \x -> ...(f Int dInt)...
   {-# RULE  f Int _ = f_spec #-}
   g = \x. f Int dInt x
Note that f_spec doesn't look recursive
After rewriting with the RULE, we get
   f_spec = \x -> ...(f_spec)...
BUT since f_spec was non-recursive before it'll *stay* non-recursive.
The occurrence analyser never turns a NonRec into a Rec.  So we must
make sure that f_spec is recursive.  Easiest thing is to make all
the specialisations for imported bindings recursive.

Note [Floating dictionaries out of cases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   g = \d. case d of { MkD sc ... -> ...(f sc)... }
Naively we can't float d2's binding out of the case expression,
because 'sc' is bound by the case, and that in turn means we can't
specialise f, which seems a pity.

So we invert the case, by floating out a binding
for 'sc_flt' thus:
    sc_flt = case d of { MkD sc ... -> sc }
Now we can float the call instance for 'f'.  Indeed this is just
what'll happen if 'sc' was originally bound with a let binding,
but case is more efficient, and necessary with equalities. So it's
good to work with both.

You might think that this won't make any difference, because the
call instance will only get nuked by the \d.  BUT if 'g' itself is
specialised, then transitively we should be able to specialise f.

In general, given
   case e of cb { MkD sc ... -> ...(f sc)... }
we transform to
   let cb_flt = e
       sc_flt = case cb_flt of { MkD sc ... -> sc }
   in
   case cb_flt of bg { MkD sc ... -> ....(f sc_flt)... }

The "_flt" things are the floated binds; we use the current substitution
to substitute sc -> sc_flt in the RHS

{- Note [Specialising DFuns]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DFuns have a special sort of unfolding (DFunUnfolding), and these are
hard to specialise a DFunUnfolding to give another DFunUnfolding
unless the DFun is fully applied (#18120).  So, in the case of DFunIds
we simply extend the CallKey with trailing UnspecArgs, so we'll
generate a rule that completely saturates the DFun.

There is an ASSERT that checks this, in the DFunUnfolding case of
GHC.Core.Unfold.specUnfolding.

Note [Specialisation Must Preserve Sharing]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a function:

    f :: forall a. Eq a => a -> blah
    f =
      if expensive
         then f1
         else f2

As written, all calls to 'f' will share 'expensive'. But if we specialise 'f'
at 'Int', eg:

    $sfInt = SUBST[a->Int,dict->dEqInt] (if expensive then f1 else f2)

    RULE "SPEC f"
      forall (d :: Eq Int).
        f Int _ = $sfIntf

We've now lost sharing between 'f' and '$sfInt' for 'expensive'. Yikes!

To avoid this, we only generate specialisations for functions whose arity is
enough to bind all of the arguments we need to specialise.  This ensures our
specialised functions don't do any work before receiving all of their dicts,
and thus avoids the 'f' case above.

Note [Specialisations Must Be Lifted]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a function 'f':

    f = forall a. Eq a => Array# a

used like

    case x of
      True -> ...f @Int dEqInt...
      False -> 0

Naively, we might generate an (expensive) specialisation

    $sfInt :: Array# Int

even in the case that @x = False@! Instead, we add a dummy 'Void#' argument to
the specialisation '$sfInt' ($sfInt :: Void# -> Array# Int) in order to
preserve laziness.

Note [Specialising Calls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have a function with a complicated type:

    f :: forall a b c. Int -> Eq a => Show b => c -> Blah
    f @a @b @c i dEqA dShowA x = blah

and suppose it is called at:

    f 7 @T1 @T2 @T3 dEqT1 ($dfShow dShowT2) t3

This call is described as a 'CallInfo' whose 'ci_key' is:

    [ SpecType T1, SpecType T2, UnspecType, UnspecArg, SpecDict dEqT1
    , SpecDict ($dfShow dShowT2), UnspecArg ]

Why are 'a' and 'b' identified as 'SpecType', while 'c' is 'UnspecType'?
Because we must specialise the function on type variables that appear
free in its *dictionary* arguments; but not on type variables that do not
appear in any dictionaries, i.e. are fully polymorphic.

Because this call has dictionaries applied, we'd like to specialise
the call on any type argument that appears free in those dictionaries.
In this case, those are [a :-> T1, b :-> T2].

We also need to substitute the dictionary binders with their
specialised dictionaries. The simplest substitution would be
[dEqA :-> dEqT1, dShowA :-> $dfShow dShowT2], but this duplicates
work, since `$dfShow dShowT2` is a function application. Therefore, we
also want to *float the dictionary out* (via bindAuxiliaryDict),
creating a new dict binding

    dShow1 = $dfShow dShowT2

and the substitution [dEqA :-> dEqT1, dShowA :-> dShow1].

With the substitutions in hand, we can generate a specialised function:

    $sf :: forall c. Int -> c -> Blah
    $sf = SUBST[a :-> T1, b :-> T2, dEqA :-> dEqT1, dShowA :-> dShow1] (\@c i x -> blah)

Note that the substitution is applied to the whole thing.  This is
convenient, but just slightly fragile.  Notably:
  * There had better be no name clashes in a/b/c

We must construct a rewrite rule:

    RULE "SPEC f @T1 @T2 _"
      forall (@c :: Type) (i :: Int) (d1 :: Eq T1) (d2 :: Show T2).
        f @T1 @T2 @c i d1 d2 = $sf @c i

In the rule, d1 and d2 are just wildcards, not used in the RHS.  Note
additionally that 'x' isn't captured by this rule --- we bind only
enough etas in order to capture all of the *specialised* arguments.

Note [Drop dead args from specialisations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When specialising a function, it’s possible some of the arguments may
actually be dead. For example, consider:

    f :: forall a. () -> Show a => a -> String
    f x y = show y ++ "!"

We might generate the following CallInfo for `f @Int`:

    [SpecType Int, UnspecArg, SpecDict $dShowInt, UnspecArg]

Normally we’d include both the x and y arguments in the
specialisation, since we’re not specialising on either of them. But
that’s silly, since x is actually unused! So we might as well drop it
in the specialisation:

    $sf :: Int -> String
    $sf y = show y ++ "!"

    {-# RULE "SPEC f @Int" forall x. f @Int x $dShow = $sf #-}

This doesn’t save us much, since the arg would be removed later by
worker/wrapper, anyway, but it’s easy to do. Note, however, that we
only drop dead arguments if:

  1. We don’t specialise on them.
  2. They come before an argument we do specialise on.

Doing the latter would require eta-expanding the RULE, which could
make it match less often, so it’s not worth it. Doing the former could
be more useful --- it would stop us from generating pointless
specialisations --- but it’s more involved to implement and unclear if
it actually provides much benefit in practice.

Note [Zap occ info in rule binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we generate a specialisation RULE, we need to drop occurrence
info on the binders. If we don’t, things go wrong when we specialise a
function like

    f :: forall a. () -> Show a => a -> String
    f x y = show y ++ "!"

since we’ll generate a RULE like

    RULE "SPEC f @Int" forall x [Occ=Dead].
      f @Int x $dShow = $sf

and Core Lint complains, even though x only appears on the LHS (due to
Note [Drop dead args from specialisations]).

Why is that a Lint error? Because the arguments on the LHS of a rule
are syntactically expressions, not patterns, so Lint treats the
appearance of x as a use rather than a binding. Fortunately, the
solution is simple: we just make sure to zap the occ info before
using ids as wildcard binders in a rule.

Note [Account for casts in binding]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: Eq a => a -> IO ()
   {-# INLINABLE f
       StableUnf = (/\a \(d:Eq a) (x:a). blah) |> g
     #-}
   f = ...

In f's stable unfolding we have done some modest simplification which
has pushed the cast to the outside.  (I wonder if this is the Right
Thing, but it's what happens now; see GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Utils Note [Casts and
lambdas].)  Now that stable unfolding must be specialised, so we want
to push the cast back inside. It would be terrible if the cast
defeated specialisation!  Hence the use of collectBindersPushingCo.

Note [Evidence foralls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose (#12212) that we are specialising
   f :: forall a b. (Num a, F a ~ F b) => blah
with a=b=Int. Then the RULE will be something like
   RULE forall (d:Num Int) (g :: F Int ~ F Int).
        f Int Int d g = f_spec
But both varToCoreExpr (when constructing the LHS args), and the
simplifier (when simplifying the LHS args), will transform to
   RULE forall (d:Num Int) (g :: F Int ~ F Int).
        f Int Int d <F Int> = f_spec
by replacing g with Refl.  So now 'g' is unbound, which results in a later
crash. So we use Refl right off the bat, and do not forall-quantify 'g':
 * varToCoreExpr generates a Refl
 * exprsFreeIdsList returns the Ids bound by the args,
   which won't include g

You might wonder if this will match as often, but the simplifier replaces
complicated Refl coercions with Refl pretty aggressively.

Note [Orphans and auto-generated rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we specialise an INLINABLE function, or when we have
-fspecialise-aggressively, we auto-generate RULES that are orphans.
We don't want to warn about these, or we'd generate a lot of warnings.
Thus, we only warn about user-specified orphan rules.

Indeed, we don't even treat the module as an orphan module if it has
auto-generated *rule* orphans.  Orphan modules are read every time we
compile, so they are pretty obtrusive and slow down every compilation,
even non-optimised ones.  (Reason: for type class instances it's a
type correctness issue.)  But specialisation rules are strictly for
*optimisation* only so it's fine not to read the interface.

What this means is that a SPEC rules from auto-specialisation in
module M will be used in other modules only if M.hi has been read for
some other reason, which is actually pretty likely.

Note [From non-recursive to recursive]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even in the non-recursive case, if any dict-binds depend on 'fn' we might
have built a recursive knot

      f a d x = <blah>
      MkUD { ud_binds = NonRec d7  (MkD ..f..)
           , ud_calls = ...(f T d7)... }

The we generate

     Rec { fs x = <blah>[T/a, d7/d]
           f a d x = <blah>
               RULE f T _ = fs
           d7 = ...f... }

Here the recursion is only through the RULE.

However we definitely should /not/ make the Rec in this wildly common
case:
      d = ...
      MkUD { ud_binds = NonRec d7 (...d...)
           , ud_calls = ...(f T d7)... }

Here we want simply to add d to the floats, giving
      MkUD { ud_binds = NonRec d (...)
                        NonRec d7 (...d...)
           , ud_calls = ...(f T d7)... }

In general, we need only make this Rec if
  - there are some specialisations (spec_binds non-empty)
  - there are some dict_binds that depend on f (dump_dbs non-empty)

Note [Avoiding loops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When specialising /dictionary functions/ we must be very careful to
avoid building loops. Here is an example that bit us badly, on
several distinct occasions.

Here is one: #3591
     class Eq a => C a
     instance Eq [a] => C [a]

This translates to
     dfun :: Eq [a] -> C [a]
     dfun a d = MkD a d (meth d)

     d4 :: Eq [T] = <blah>
     d2 ::  C [T] = dfun T d4
     d1 :: Eq [T] = $p1 d2
     d3 ::  C [T] = dfun T d1

None of these definitions is recursive. What happened was that we
generated a specialisation:
     RULE forall d. dfun T d = dT  :: C [T]
     dT = (MkD a d (meth d)) [T/a, d1/d]
        = MkD T d1 (meth d1)

But now we use the RULE on the RHS of d2, to get
    d2 = dT = MkD d1 (meth d1)
    d1 = $p1 d2

and now d1 is bottom!  The problem is that when specialising 'dfun' we
should first dump "below" the binding all floated dictionary bindings
that mention 'dfun' itself.  So d2 and d3 (and hence d1) must be
placed below 'dfun', and thus unavailable to it when specialising
'dfun'.  That in turn means that the call (dfun T d1) must be
discarded.  On the other hand, the call (dfun T d4) is fine, assuming
d4 doesn't mention dfun.

Solution:
  Discard all calls that mention dictionaries that depend
  (directly or indirectly) on the dfun we are specialising.
  This is done by 'filterCalls'

--------------
Here's yet another example

  class C a where { foo,bar :: [a] -> [a] }

  instance C Int where
     foo x = r_bar x
     bar xs = reverse xs

  r_bar :: C a => [a] -> [a]
  r_bar xs = bar (xs ++ xs)

That translates to:

    r_bar a (c::C a) (xs::[a]) = bar a d (xs ++ xs)

    Rec { $fCInt :: C Int = MkC foo_help reverse
          foo_help (xs::[Int]) = r_bar Int $fCInt xs }

The call (r_bar $fCInt) mentions $fCInt,
                        which mentions foo_help,
                        which mentions r_bar
But we DO want to specialise r_bar at Int:

    Rec { $fCInt :: C Int = MkC foo_help reverse
          foo_help (xs::[Int]) = r_bar Int $fCInt xs

          r_bar a (c::C a) (xs::[a]) = bar a d (xs ++ xs)
            RULE r_bar Int _ = r_bar_Int

          r_bar_Int xs = bar Int $fCInt (xs ++ xs)
           }

Note that, because of its RULE, r_bar joins the recursive
group.  (In this case it'll unravel a short moment later.)


Note [Specialising a recursive group]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
    let rec { f x = ...g x'...
            ; g y = ...f y'.... }
    in f 'a'
Here we specialise 'f' at Char; but that is very likely to lead to
a specialisation of 'g' at Char.  We must do the latter, else the
whole point of specialisation is lost.

But we do not want to keep iterating to a fixpoint, because in the
presence of polymorphic recursion we might generate an infinite number
of specialisations.

So we use the following heuristic:
  * Arrange the rec block in dependency order, so far as possible
    (the occurrence analyser already does this)

  * Specialise it much like a sequence of lets

  * Then go through the block a second time, feeding call-info from
    the RHSs back in the bottom, as it were

In effect, the ordering maxmimises the effectiveness of each sweep,
and we do just two sweeps.   This should catch almost every case of
monomorphic recursion -- the exception could be a very knotted-up
recursion with multiple cycles tied up together.

This plan is implemented in the Rec case of specBindItself.

Note [Specialisations already covered]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We obviously don't want to generate two specialisations for the same
argument pattern.  There are two wrinkles

1. We do the already-covered test in specDefn, not when we generate
the CallInfo in mkCallUDs.  We used to test in the latter place, but
we now iterate the specialiser somewhat, and the Id at the call site
might therefore not have all the RULES that we can see in specDefn

2. What about two specialisations where the second is an *instance*
of the first?  If the more specific one shows up first, we'll generate
specialisations for both.  If the *less* specific one shows up first,
we *don't* currently generate a specialisation for the more specific
one.  (See the call to lookupRule in already_covered.)  Reasons:
  (a) lookupRule doesn't say which matches are exact (bad reason)
  (b) if the earlier specialisation is user-provided, it's
      far from clear that we should auto-specialise further

Note [Auto-specialisation and RULES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider:
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g = ...

   f :: (Int -> Int) -> Int
   f w = ...
   {-# RULE f g = 0 #-}

Suppose that auto-specialisation makes a specialised version of
g::Int->Int That version won't appear in the LHS of the RULE for f.
So if the specialisation rule fires too early, the rule for f may
never fire.

It might be possible to add new rules, to "complete" the rewrite system.
Thus when adding
        RULE forall d. g Int d = g_spec
also add
        RULE f g_spec = 0

But that's a bit complicated.  For now we ask the programmer's help,
by *copying the INLINE activation pragma* to the auto-specialised
rule.  So if g says {-# NOINLINE[2] g #-}, then the auto-spec rule
will also not be active until phase 2.  And that's what programmers
should jolly well do anyway, even aside from specialisation, to ensure
that g doesn't inline too early.

This in turn means that the RULE would never fire for a NOINLINE
thing so not much point in generating a specialisation at all.

Note [Specialisation shape]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We only specialise a function if it has visible top-level lambdas
corresponding to its overloading.  E.g. if
        f :: forall a. Eq a => ....
then its body must look like
        f = /\a. \d. ...

Reason: when specialising the body for a call (f ty dexp), we want to
substitute dexp for d, and pick up specialised calls in the body of f.

This doesn't always work.  One example I came across was this:
        newtype Gen a = MkGen{ unGen :: Int -> a }

        choose :: Eq a => a -> Gen a
        choose n = MkGen (\r -> n)

        oneof = choose (1::Int)

It's a silly example, but we get
        choose = /\a. g `cast` co
where choose doesn't have any dict arguments.  Thus far I have not
tried to fix this (wait till there's a real example).

Mind you, then 'choose' will be inlined (since RHS is trivial) so
it doesn't matter.  This comes up with single-method classes

   class C a where { op :: a -> a }
   instance C a => C [a] where ....
==>
   $fCList :: C a => C [a]
   $fCList = $copList |> (...coercion>...)
   ....(uses of $fCList at particular types)...

So we suppress the WARN if the rhs is trivial.

Note [Inline specialisations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what we do with the InlinePragma of the original function
  * Activation/RuleMatchInfo: both transferred to the
                              specialised function
  * InlineSpec:
       (a) An INLINE pragma is transferred
       (b) An INLINABLE pragma is *not* transferred

Why (a): transfer INLINE pragmas? The point of INLINE was precisely to
specialise the function at its call site, and arguably that's not so
important for the specialised copies.  BUT *pragma-directed*
specialisation now takes place in the typechecker/desugarer, with
manually specified INLINEs.  The specialisation here is automatic.
It'd be very odd if a function marked INLINE was specialised (because
of some local use), and then forever after (including importing
modules) the specialised version wasn't INLINEd.  After all, the
programmer said INLINE!

You might wonder why we specialise INLINE functions at all.  After
all they should be inlined, right?  Two reasons:

 * Even INLINE functions are sometimes not inlined, when they aren't
   applied to interesting arguments.  But perhaps the type arguments
   alone are enough to specialise (even though the args are too boring
   to trigger inlining), and it's certainly better to call the
   specialised version.

 * The RHS of an INLINE function might call another overloaded function,
   and we'd like to generate a specialised version of that function too.
   This actually happens a lot. Consider
      replicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINABLE replicateM_ #-}
      replicateM_ d x ma = ...
   The strictness analyser may transform to
      replicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINE replicateM_ #-}
      replicateM_ d x ma = case x of I# x' -> $wreplicateM_ d x' ma

      $wreplicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int# -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINABLE $wreplicateM_ #-}
      $wreplicateM_ = ...
   Now an importing module has a specialised call to replicateM_, say
   (replicateM_ dMonadIO).  We certainly want to specialise $wreplicateM_!
   This particular example had a huge effect on the call to replicateM_
   in nofib/shootout/n-body.

Why (b): discard INLINABLE pragmas? See #4874 for persuasive examples.
Suppose we have
    {-# INLINABLE f #-}
    f :: Ord a => [a] -> Int
    f xs = letrec f' = ...f'... in f'
Then, when f is specialised and optimised we might get
    wgo :: [Int] -> Int#
    wgo = ...wgo...
    f_spec :: [Int] -> Int
    f_spec xs = case wgo xs of { r -> I# r }
and we clearly want to inline f_spec at call sites.  But if we still
have the big, un-optimised of f (albeit specialised) captured in an
INLINABLE pragma for f_spec, we won't get that optimisation.

So we simply drop INLINABLE pragmas when specialising. It's not really
a complete solution; ignoring specialisation for now, INLINABLE functions
don't get properly strictness analysed, for example. But it works well
for examples involving specialisation, which is the dominant use of
INLINABLE.  See #4874.

{-
Note [Make the new dictionaries interesting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Important!  We're going to substitute dx_id1 for d
and we want it to look "interesting", else we won't gather *any*
consequential calls. E.g.
    f d = ...g d....
If we specialise f for a call (f (dfun dNumInt)), we'll get
a consequent call (g d') with an auxiliary definition
    d' = df dNumInt
We want that consequent call to look interesting

Note [Keep the old dictionaries interesting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In bindAuxiliaryDict, we don’t bother creating a new dict binding if
the dict expression is trivial. For example, if we have

    f = \ @m1 (d1 :: Monad m1) -> ...

and we specialize it at the pattern

    [SpecType IO, SpecArg $dMonadIO]

it would be silly to create a new binding for $dMonadIO; it’s already
a binding! So we just extend the substitution directly:

    m1 :-> IO
    d1 :-> $dMonadIO

But this creates a new subtlety: the dict expression might be a dict
binding we floated out while specializing another function. For
example, we might have

    d2 = $p1Monad $dMonadIO -- floated out by bindAuxiliaryDict
    $sg = h @IO d2
    h = \ @m2 (d2 :: Applicative m2) -> ...

and end up specializing h at the following pattern:

    [SpecType IO, SpecArg d2]

When we created the d2 binding in the first place, we locally marked
it as interesting while specializing g as described above by
Note [Make the new dictionaries interesting]. But when we go to
specialize h, it isn’t in the SpecEnv anymore, so we’ve lost the
knowledge that we should specialize on it.

To fix this, we have to explicitly add d2 *back* to the interesting
set. That way, it will still be considered interesting while
specializing the body of h. See !2913.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We float out dictionary bindings for the reasons described under
"Dictionary floating" above.  But not /just/ dictionary bindings.
Consider

   f :: Eq a => blah
   f a d = rhs

   $c== :: T -> T -> Bool
   $c== x y = ...

   $df :: Eq T
   $df = Eq $c== ...

   gurgle = ...(f @T $df)...

We gather the call info for (f @T $df), and we don't want to drop it
when we come across the binding for $df.  So we add $df to the floats
and continue.  But then we have to add $c== to the floats, and so on.
These all float above the binding for 'f', and now we can
successfully specialise 'f'.

So the DictBinds in (ud_binds :: Bag DictBind) may contain
non-dictionary bindings too.

purposes of specialisation.  Note that we still want to specialise
functions with implicit params if they have *other* dicts which are
class params; see #17930.

One apparent additional complexity involves type families. For
example, consider
         type family D (v::*->*) :: Constraint
         type instance D [] = ()
         f :: D v => v Char -> Int
If we see a call (f "foo"), we'll pass a "dictionary"
  () |> (g :: () ~ D [])
and it's good to specialise f at this dictionary.

So the question is: can an implicit parameter "hide inside" a
type-family constraint like (D a).  Well, no.  We don't allow
        type instance D Maybe = ?x:Int
Hence the IrredPred case in type_determines_value.  See #7785.

Note [Interesting dictionary arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this
         \a.\d:Eq a.  let f = ... in ...(f d)...
There really is not much point in specialising f wrt the dictionary d,
because the code for the specialised f is not improved at all, because
d is lambda-bound.  We simply get junk specialisations.

What is "interesting"?  Just that it has *some* structure.  But what about
variables?

 * A variable might be imported, in which case its unfolding
   will tell us whether it has useful structure

 * Local variables are cloned on the way down (to avoid clashes when
   we float dictionaries), and cloning drops the unfolding
   (cloneIdBndr).  Moreover, we make up some new bindings, and it's a
   nuisance to give them unfoldings.  So we keep track of the
   "interesting" dictionaries as a VarSet in SpecEnv.
   We have to take care to put any new interesting dictionary
   bindings in the set.

We accidentally lost accurate tracking of local variables for a long
time, because cloned variables don't have unfoldings. But makes a
massive difference in a few cases, eg #5113. For nofib as a
whole it's only a small win: 2.2% improvement in allocation for ansi,
1.2% for bspt, but mostly 0.0!  Average 0.1% increase in binary size.

{-
                Old (but interesting) stuff about unboxed bindings
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What should we do when a value is specialised to a *strict* unboxed value?

        map_*_* f (x:xs) = let h = f x
                               t = map f xs
                           in h:t

Could convert let to case:

        map_*_Int# f (x:xs) = case f x of h# ->
                              let t = map f xs
                              in h#:t

This may be undesirable since it forces evaluation here, but the value
may not be used in all branches of the body. In the general case this
transformation is impossible since the mutual recursion in a letrec
cannot be expressed as a case.

There is also a problem with top-level unboxed values, since our
implementation cannot handle unboxed values at the top level.

Solution: Lift the binding of the unboxed value and extract it when it
is used:

        map_*_Int# f (x:xs) = let h = case (f x) of h# -> _Lift h#
                                  t = map f xs
                              in case h of
                                 _Lift h# -> h#:t

Now give it to the simplifier and the _Lifting will be optimised away.

The benefit is that we have given the specialised "unboxed" values a
very simple lifted semantics and then leave it up to the simplifier to
optimise it --- knowing that the overheads will be removed in nearly
all cases.

In particular, the value will only be evaluated in the branches of the
program which use it, rather than being forced at the point where the
value is bound. For example:

        filtermap_*_* p f (x:xs)
          = let h = f x
                t = ...
            in case p x of
                True  -> h:t
                False -> t
   ==>
        filtermap_*_Int# p f (x:xs)
          = let h = case (f x) of h# -> _Lift h#
                t = ...
            in case p x of
                True  -> case h of _Lift h#
                           -> h#:t
                False -> t

The binding for h can still be inlined in the one branch and the
_Lifting eliminated.


Question: When won't the _Lifting be eliminated?

Answer: When they at the top-level (where it is necessary) or when
inlining would duplicate work (or possibly code depending on
options). However, the _Lifting will still be eliminated if the
strictness analyser deems the lifted binding strict.
