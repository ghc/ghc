Unification is much tricker than you might think.

1. The substitution we generate binds the *template type variables*
   which are given to us explicitly.

2. We want to match in the presence of foralls;
        e.g     (forall a. t1) ~ (forall b. t2)

   That is what the RnEnv2 is for; it does the alpha-renaming
   that makes it as if a and b were the same variable.
   Initialising the RnEnv2, so that it can generate a fresh
   binder when necessary, entails knowing the free variables of
   both types.

3. We must be careful not to bind a template type variable to a
   locally bound variable.  E.g.
        (forall a. x) ~ (forall b. b)
   where x is the template type variable.  Then we do not want to
   bind x to a/b!  This is a kind of occurs check.
   The necessary locals accumulate in the RnEnv2.

Note [tcMatchTy vs tcMatchTyKi]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module offers two variants of matching: with kinds and without.
The TyKi variant takes two types, of potentially different kinds,
and matches them. Along the way, it necessarily also matches their
kinds. The Ty variant instead assumes that the kinds are already
eqType and so skips matching up the kinds.

How do you choose between them?

1. If you know that the kinds of the two types are eqType, use
   the Ty variant. It is more efficient, as it does less work.

2. If the kinds of variables in the template type might mention type families,
   use the Ty variant (and do other work to make sure the kinds
   work out). These pure unification functions do a straightforward
   syntactic unification and do no complex reasoning about type
   families. Note that the types of the variables in instances can indeed
   mention type families, so instance lookup must use the Ty variant.

   (Nothing goes terribly wrong -- no panics -- if there might be type
   families in kinds in the TyKi variant. You just might get match
   failure even though a reducing a type family would lead to success.)

3. Otherwise, if you're sure that the variable kinds do not mention
   type families and you're not already sure that the kind of the template
   equals the kind of the target, then use the TyKi version.

Note [Pruning dead case alternatives]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider        data T a where
                   T1 :: T Int
                   T2 :: T a

                newtype X = MkX Int
                newtype Y = MkY Char

                type family F a
                type instance F Bool = Int

Now consider    case x of { T1 -> e1; T2 -> e2 }

The question before the house is this: if I know something about the type
of x, can I prune away the T1 alternative?

Suppose x::T Char.  It's impossible to construct a (T Char) using T1,
        Answer = YES we can prune the T1 branch (clearly)

Suppose x::T (F a), where 'a' is in scope.  Then 'a' might be instantiated
to 'Bool', in which case x::T Int, so
        ANSWER = NO (clearly)

We see here that we want precisely the apartness check implemented within
tcUnifyTysFG. So that's what we do! Two types cannot match if they are surely
apart. Note that since we are simply dropping dead code, a conservative test
suffices.

Note [Fine-grained unification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do the types (x, x) and ([y], y) unify? The answer is seemingly "no" --
no substitution to finite types makes these match. But, a substitution to
*infinite* types can unify these two types: [x |-> [[[...]]], y |-> [[[...]]] ].
Why do we care? Consider these two type family instances:

type instance F x x   = Int
type instance F [y] y = Bool

If we also have

type instance Looper = [Looper]

then the instances potentially overlap. The solution is to use unification
over infinite terms. This is possible (see [1] for lots of gory details), but
a full algorithm is a little more power than we need. Instead, we make a
conservative approximation and just omit the occurs check.

[1]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ext-f/axioms-extended.pdf

tcUnifyTys considers an occurs-check problem as the same as general unification
failure.

tcUnifyTysFG ("fine-grained") returns one of three results: success, occurs-check
failure ("MaybeApart"), or general failure ("SurelyApart").

See also #8162.

It's worth noting that unification in the presence of infinite types is not
complete. This means that, sometimes, a closed type family does not reduce
when it should. See test case indexed-types/should_fail/Overlap15 for an
example.

Note [Unification result]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When unifying t1 ~ t2, we return
* Unifiable s, if s is a substitution such that s(t1) is syntactically the
  same as s(t2), modulo type-synonym expansion.
* SurelyApart, if there is no substitution s such that s(t1) = s(t2),
  where "=" includes type-family reductions.
* MaybeApart mar s, when we aren't sure. `mar` is a MaybeApartReason.

Examples
* [a] ~ Maybe b: SurelyApart, because [] and Maybe can't unify
* [(a,Int)] ~ [(Bool,b)]:  Unifiable
* [F Int] ~ [Bool]: MaybeApart MARTypeFamily, because F Int might reduce to Bool (the unifier
                    does not try this)
* a ~ Maybe a: MaybeApart MARInfinite. Not Unifiable clearly, but not SurelyApart either; consider
       a := Loop
       where  type family Loop where Loop = Maybe Loop

There is the possibility that two types are MaybeApart for *both* reasons:

* (a, F Int) ~ (Maybe a, Bool)

What reason should we use? The *only* consumer of the reason is described
in Note [Infinitary substitution in lookup] in GHC.Core.InstEnv. The goal
there is identify which instances might match a target later (but don't
match now) -- except that we want to ignore the possibility of infinitary
substitutions. So let's examine a concrete scenario:

  class C a b c
  instance C a (Maybe a) Bool
  -- other instances, including one that will actually match
  [W] C b b (F Int)

Do we want the instance as a future possibility? No. The only way that
instance can match is in the presence of an infinite type (infinitely
nested Maybes). We thus say that MARInfinite takes precedence, so that
InstEnv treats this case as an infinitary substitution case; the fact
that a type family is involved is only incidental. We thus define
the Semigroup instance for MaybeApartReason to prefer MARInfinite.

Note [The substitution in MaybeApart]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The constructor MaybeApart carries data with it, typically a TvSubstEnv. Why?
Because consider unifying these:

(a, a, Int) ~ (b, [b], Bool)

If we go left-to-right, we start with [a |-> b]. Then, on the middle terms, we
apply the subst we have so far and discover that we need [b |-> [b]]. Because
this fails the occurs check, we say that the types are MaybeApart (see above
Note [Fine-grained unification]). But, we can't stop there! Because if we
continue, we discover that Int is SurelyApart from Bool, and therefore the
types are apart. This has practical consequences for the ability for closed
type family applications to reduce. See test case
indexed-types/should_compile/Overlap14.

Note [Rewrite rules ignore multiplicities in FunTy]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following (higher-order) rule:

m :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
{-# RULES "m" forall f. m (f True) = f #-}

let x = m ((,) @Bool @Bool True True)

The rewrite rule expects an `f :: Bool -> Bool`, but `(,) @Bool @Bool True ::
Bool %1 -> Bool` is linear (see Note [Data constructors are linear by default]
in GHC.Core.Multiplicity) Should the rule match? Yes! According to the
principles laid out in Note [Linting linearity] in GHC.Core.Lint, optimisation
shouldn't be constrained by linearity.

However, when matching the template variable `f` to `(,) True`, we do check that
their types unify (see Note [Matching variable types] in GHC.Core.Rules). So
when unifying types for the sake of rule-matching, the unification algorithm
must be able to ignore multiplicities altogether.

How is this done?
  (1) The `um_arr_mult` field of `UMEnv` recordsw when we are doing rule-matching,
      and hence want to ignore multiplicities.
  (2) The field is set to True in by `ruleMatchTyKiX`.
  (3) It is consulted when matching `FunTy` in `unify_ty`.

Wrinkle in (3). In `unify_tc_app`, in `unify_ty`, `FunTy` is handled as if it
was a regular type constructor. In this case, and when the types being unified
are *function* arrows, but not constraint arrows, then the first argument is a
multiplicity.

We select this situation by comparing the type constructor with fUNTyCon. In
this case, and this case only, we can safely drop the first argument (using the
tail function) and unify the rest.

Note [Non-idempotent substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During unification we use a TvSubstEnv/CvSubstEnv pair that is
  (a) non-idempotent
  (b) loop-free; ie repeatedly applying it yields a fixed point

Note [Finding the substitution fixpoint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finding the fixpoint of a non-idempotent substitution arising from a
unification is much trickier than it looks, because of kinds.  Consider
   T k (H k (f:k)) ~ T * (g:*)
If we unify, we get the substitution
   [ k -> *
   , g -> H k (f:k) ]
To make it idempotent we don't want to get just
   [ k -> *
   , g -> H * (f:k) ]
We also want to substitute inside f's kind, to get
   [ k -> *
   , g -> H k (f:*) ]
If we don't do this, we may apply the substitution to something,
and get an ill-formed type, i.e. one where typeKind will fail.
This happened, for example, in #9106.

It gets worse.  In #14164 we wanted to take the fixpoint of
this substitution
   [ xs_asV :-> F a_aY6 (z_aY7 :: a_aY6)
                        (rest_aWF :: G a_aY6 (z_aY7 :: a_aY6))
   , a_aY6  :-> a_aXQ ]

We have to apply the substitution for a_aY6 two levels deep inside
the invocation of F!  We don't have a function that recursively
applies substitutions inside the kinds of variable occurrences (and
probably rightly so).

So, we work as follows:

 1. Start with the current substitution (which we are
    trying to fixpoint
       [ xs :-> F a (z :: a) (rest :: G a (z :: a))
       , a  :-> b ]

 2. Take all the free vars of the range of the substitution:
       {a, z, rest, b}
    NB: the free variable finder closes over
    the kinds of variable occurrences

 3. If none are in the domain of the substitution, stop.
    We have found a fixpoint.

 4. Remove the variables that are bound by the substitution, leaving
       {z, rest, b}

 5. Do a topo-sort to put them in dependency order:
       [ b :: *, z :: a, rest :: G a z ]

 6. Apply the substitution left-to-right to the kinds of these
    tyvars, extending it each time with a new binding, so we
    finish up with
       [ xs   :-> ..as before..
       , a    :-> b
       , b    :-> b    :: *
       , z    :-> z    :: b
       , rest :-> rest :: G b (z :: b) ]
    Note that rest now has the right kind

 7. Apply this extended substitution (once) to the range of
    the /original/ substitution.  (Note that we do the
    extended substitution would go on forever if you tried
    to find its fixpoint, because it maps z to z.)

 8. And go back to step 1

In Step 6 we use the free vars from Step 2 as the initial
in-scope set, because all of those variables appear in the
range of the substitution, so they must all be in the in-scope
set.  But NB that the type substitution engine does not look up
variables in the in-scope set; it is used only to ensure no
shadowing.

Note [Specification of unification]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pure unifier, unify_ty, defined in this module, tries to work out
a substitution to make two types say True to eqType. NB: eqType is
itself not purely syntactic; it accounts for CastTys;
see Note [Non-trivial definitional equality] in GHC.Core.TyCo.Rep

Unlike the "impure unifiers" in the typechecker (the eager unifier in
GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify, and the constraint solver itself in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality),
the pure unifier does /not/ work up to ~.

The algorithm implemented here is rather delicate, and we depend on it
to uphold certain properties. This is a summary of these required
properties.

Notation:
 θ,φ  substitutions
 ξ    type-function-free types
 τ,σ  other types
 τ♭   type τ, flattened

 ≡    eqType

(U1) Soundness.
     If (unify τ₁ τ₂) = Unifiable θ, then θ(τ₁) ≡ θ(τ₂).
     θ is a most general unifier for τ₁ and τ₂.

(U2) Completeness.
     If (unify ξ₁ ξ₂) = SurelyApart,
     then there exists no substitution θ such that θ(ξ₁) ≡ θ(ξ₂).

These two properties are stated as Property 11 in the "Closed Type Families"
paper (POPL'14). Below, this paper is called [CTF].

(U3) Apartness under substitution.
     If (unify ξ τ♭) = SurelyApart, then (unify ξ θ(τ)♭) = SurelyApart,
     for any θ. (Property 12 from [CTF])

(U4) Apart types do not unify.
     If (unify ξ τ♭) = SurelyApart, then there exists no θ
     such that θ(ξ) = θ(τ). (Property 13 from [CTF])

THEOREM. Completeness w.r.t ~
    If (unify τ₁♭ τ₂♭) = SurelyApart,
    then there exists no proof that (τ₁ ~ τ₂).

PROOF. See appendix of [CTF].


The unification algorithm is used for type family injectivity, as described
in the "Injective Type Families" paper (Haskell'15), called [ITF]. When run
in this mode, it has the following properties.

(I1) If (unify σ τ) = SurelyApart, then σ and τ are not unifiable, even
     after arbitrary type family reductions. Note that σ and τ are
     not flattened here.

(I2) If (unify σ τ) = MaybeApart θ, and if some
     φ exists such that φ(σ) ~ φ(τ), then φ extends θ.


Furthermore, the RULES matching algorithm requires this property,
but only when using this algorithm for matching:

(M1) If (match σ τ) succeeds with θ, then all matchable tyvars
     in σ are bound in θ.

     Property M1 means that we must extend the substitution with,
     say (a ↦ a) when appropriate during matching.
     See also Note [Self-substitution when matching].

(M2) Completeness of matching.
     If θ(σ) = τ, then (match σ τ) = Unifiable φ,
     where θ is an extension of φ.

Sadly, property M2 and I2 conflict. Consider

type family F1 a b where
  F1 Int    Bool   = Char
  F1 Double String = Char

Consider now two matching problems:

P1. match (F1 a Bool) (F1 Int Bool)
P2. match (F1 a Bool) (F1 Double String)

In case P1, we must find (a ↦ Int) to satisfy M2.
In case P2, we must /not/ find (a ↦ Double), in order to satisfy I2. (Note
that the correct mapping for I2 is (a ↦ Int). There is no way to discover
this, but we mustn't map a to anything else!)

We thus must parameterize the algorithm over whether it's being used
for an injectivity check (refrain from looking at non-injective arguments
to type families) or not (do indeed look at those arguments).  This is
implemented  by the um_inj_tf field of UMEnv.

(It's all a question of whether or not to include equation (7) from Fig. 2
of [ITF].)

This extra parameter is a bit fiddly, perhaps, but seemingly less so than
having two separate, almost-identical algorithms.

Note [Self-substitution when matching]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What should happen when we're *matching* (not unifying) a1 with a1? We
should get a substitution [a1 |-> a1]. A successful match should map all
the template variables (except ones that disappear when expanding synonyms).
But when unifying, we don't want to do this, because we'll then fall into
a loop.

This arrangement affects the code in three places:
 - If we're matching a refined template variable, don't recur. Instead, just
   check for equality. That is, if we know [a |-> Maybe a] and are matching
   (a ~? Maybe Int), we want to just fail.

 - Skip the occurs check when matching. This comes up in two places, because
   matching against variables is handled separately from matching against
   full-on types.

Note that this arrangement was provoked by a real failure, where the same
unique ended up in the template as in the target. (It was a rule firing when
compiling Data.List.NonEmpty.)

Note [Matching coercion variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:

   type family F a

   data G a where
     MkG :: F a ~ Bool => G a

   type family Foo (x :: G a) :: F a
   type instance Foo MkG = False

We would like that to be accepted. For that to work, we need to introduce
a coercion variable on the left and then use it on the right. Accordingly,
at use sites of Foo, we need to be able to use matching to figure out the
value for the coercion. (See the desugared version:

   axFoo :: [a :: *, c :: F a ~ Bool]. Foo (MkG c) = False |> (sym c)

) We never want this action to happen during *unification* though, when
all bets are off.

Note [Kind coercions in Unify]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We wish to match/unify while ignoring casts. But, we can't just ignore
them completely, or we'll end up with ill-kinded substitutions. For example,
say we're matching `a` with `ty |> co`. If we just drop the cast, we'll
return [a |-> ty], but `a` and `ty` might have different kinds. We can't
just match/unify their kinds, either, because this might gratuitously
fail. After all, `co` is the witness that the kinds are the same -- they
may look nothing alike.

So, we pass a kind coercion to the match/unify worker. This coercion witnesses
the equality between the substed kind of the left-hand type and the substed
kind of the right-hand type. Note that we do not unify kinds at the leaves
(as we did previously). We thus have

Hence: (Unification Kind Invariant)
-----------------------------------
In the call
     unify_ty ty1 ty2 kco
it must be that
     subst(kco) :: subst(kind(ty1)) ~N subst(kind(ty2))
where `subst` is the ambient substitution in the UM monad.  And in the call
     unify_tys tys1 tys2
(which has no kco), after we unify any prefix of tys1,tys2, the kinds of the
head of the remaining tys1,tys2 are identical after substitution.  This
implies, for example, that the kinds of the head of tys1,tys2 are identical
after substitution.

To get this coercion, we first have to match/unify
the kinds before looking at the types. Happily, we need look only one level
up, as all kinds are guaranteed to have kind *.

When we're working with type applications (either TyConApp or AppTy) we
need to worry about establishing INVARIANT, as the kinds of the function
& arguments aren't (necessarily) included in the kind of the result.
When unifying two TyConApps, this is easy, because the two TyCons are
the same. Their kinds are thus the same. As long as we unify left-to-right,
we'll be sure to unify types' kinds before the types themselves. (For example,
think about Proxy :: forall k. k -> *. Unifying the first args matches up
the kinds of the second args.)

For AppTy, we must unify the kinds of the functions, but once these are
unified, we can continue unifying arguments without worrying further about
kinds.

The interface to this module includes both "...Ty" functions and
"...TyKi" functions. The former assume that INVARIANT is already
established, either because the kinds are the same or because the
list of types being passed in are the well-typed arguments to some
type constructor (see two paragraphs above). The latter take a separate
pre-pass over the kinds to establish INVARIANT. Sometimes, it's important
not to take the second pass, as it caused #12442.

We thought, at one point, that this was all unnecessary: why should
casts be in types in the first place? But they are sometimes. In
dependent/should_compile/KindEqualities2, we see, for example the
constraint Num (Int |> (blah ; sym blah)).  We naturally want to find
a dictionary for that constraint, which requires dealing with
coercions in this manner.

Note [Matching in the presence of casts (1)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When matching, it is crucial that no variables from the template
end up in the range of the matching substitution (obviously!).
When unifying, that's not a constraint; instead we take the fixpoint
of the substitution at the end.

So what should we do with this, when matching?
   unify_ty (tmpl |> co) tgt kco

Previously, wrongly, we pushed 'co' in the (horrid) accumulating
'kco' argument like this:
   unify_ty (tmpl |> co) tgt kco
     = unify_ty tmpl tgt (kco ; co)

But that is obviously wrong because 'co' (from the template) ends
up in 'kco', which in turn ends up in the range of the substitution.

This all came up in #13910.  Because we match tycon arguments
left-to-right, the ambient substitution will already have a matching
substitution for any kinds; so there is an easy fix: just apply
the substitution-so-far to the coercion from the LHS.

Note that

* When matching, the first arg of unify_ty is always the template;
  we never swap round.

* The above argument is distressingly indirect. We seek a
  better way.

* One better way is to ensure that type patterns (the template
  in the matching process) have no casts.  See #14119.

Note [Matching in the presence of casts (2)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is another wrinkle (#17395).  Suppose (T :: forall k. k -> Type)
and we are matching
   tcMatchTy (T k (a::k))  (T j (b::j))

Then we'll match k :-> j, as expected. But then in unify_tys
we invoke
   unify_tys env (a::k) (b::j) (Refl j)

Although we have unified k and j, it's very important that we put
(Refl j), /not/ (Refl k) as the fourth argument to unify_tys.
If we put (Refl k) we'd end up with the substitution
  a :-> b |> Refl k
which is bogus because one of the template variables, k,
appears in the range of the substitution.  Eek.

Similar care is needed in unify_ty_app.


Note [Polykinded tycon applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose  T :: forall k. Type -> K
and we are unifying
  ty1:  T @Type         Int       :: Type
  ty2:  T @(Type->Type) Int Int   :: Type

These two TyConApps have the same TyCon at the front but they
(legitimately) have different numbers of arguments.  They
are surelyApart, so we can report that without looking any
further (see #15704).

Note [Unifying type applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unifying type applications is quite subtle, as we found
in #23134 and #22647, when type families are involved.

Suppose
   type family F a :: Type -> Type
   type family G k :: k = r | r -> k

and consider these examples:

* F Int ~ F Char, where F is injective
  Since F is injective, we can reduce this to Int ~ Char,
  therefore SurelyApart.

* F Int ~ F Char, where F is not injective
  Without injectivity, return MaybeApart.

* G Type ~ G (Type -> Type) Int
  Even though G is injective and the arguments to G are different,
  we cannot deduce apartness because the RHS is oversaturated.
  For example, G might be defined as
    G Type = Maybe Int
    G (Type -> Type) = Maybe
  So we return MaybeApart.

* F Int Bool ~ F Int Char       -- SurelyApart (since Bool is apart from Char)
  F Int Bool ~ Maybe a          -- MaybeApart
  F Int Bool ~ a b              -- MaybeApart
  F Int Bool ~ Char -> Bool     -- MaybeApart
  An oversaturated type family can match an application,
  whether it's a TyConApp, AppTy or FunTy. Decompose.

* F Int ~ a b
  We cannot decompose a saturated, or under-saturated
  type family application. We return MaybeApart.

To handle all those conditions, unify_ty goes through
the following checks in sequence, where Fn is a type family
of arity n:

* (C1) Fn x_1 ... x_n ~ Fn y_1 .. y_n
  A saturated application.
  Here we can unify arguments in which Fn is injective.
* (C2) Fn x_1 ... x_n ~ anything, anything ~ Fn x_1 ... x_n
  A saturated type family can match anything - we return MaybeApart.
* (C3) Fn x_1 ... x_m ~ a b, a b ~ Fn x_1 ... x_m where m > n
  An oversaturated type family can be decomposed.
* (C4) Fn x_1 ... x_m ~ anything, anything ~ Fn x_1 ... x_m, where m > n
  If we couldn't decompose in the previous step, we return SurelyApart.

Afterwards, the rest of the code doesn't have to worry about type families.

Note [Unifying type synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the task of unifying two 'Type's of the form

  TyConApp tc [] ~ TyConApp tc []

where `tc` is a type synonym. A naive way to perform this comparison these
would first expand the synonym and then compare the resulting expansions.

However, this is obviously wasteful and the RHS of `tc` may be large; it is
much better to rather compare the TyCons directly. Consequently, before
expanding type synonyms in type comparisons we first look for a nullary
TyConApp and simply compare the TyCons if we find one.

Of course, if we find that the TyCons are *not* equal then we still need to
perform the expansion as their RHSs may still be unifiable.  E.g
    type T = S (a->a)
    type S a = [a]
and consider
    T Int ~ S (Int -> Int)

We can't decompose non-nullary synonyms.  E.g.
    type R a = F a    -- Where F is a type family
and consider
    R (a->a) ~ R Int
We can't conclude that  (a->) ~ Int.  (There is a currently-missed opportunity
here; if we knew that R was /injective/, perhaps we could decompose.)

We perform the nullary-type-synonym optimisation in a number of places:

 * GHC.Core.Unify.unify_ty
 * GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.can_eq_nc'
 * GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.uType

This optimisation is especially helpful for the ubiquitous GHC.Types.Type,
since GHC prefers to use the type synonym over @TYPE 'LiftedRep@ applications
whenever possible. See Note [Using synonyms to compress types] in
GHC.Core.Type for details.

-- | 'liftCoMatch' is sort of inverse to 'liftCoSubst'.  In particular, if

--   where @==@ there means that the result of 'liftCoSubst' has the same
--   type as the original co; but may be different under the hood.
--   That is, it matches a type against a coercion of the same
--   "shape", and returns a lifting substitution which could have been
--   used to produce the given coercion from the given type.
--   Note that this function is incomplete -- it might return Nothing
--   when there does indeed exist a possible lifting context.
--
-- This function is incomplete in that it doesn't respect the equality
-- in `eqType`. That is, it's possible that this will succeed for t1 and
-- fail for t2, even when t1 `eqType` t2. That's because it depends on
-- there being a very similar structure between the type and the coercion.
-- This incompleteness shouldn't be all that surprising, especially because
-- it depends on the structure of the coercion, which is a silly thing to do.
--
-- The lifting context produced doesn't have to be exacting in the roles
-- of the mappings. This is because any use of the lifting context will
-- also require a desired role. Thus, this algorithm prefers mapping to

Note [Flattening type-family applications when matching instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in "Closed type families with overlapping equations"
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ext-f/axioms-extended.pdf
we need to flatten core types before unifying them, when checking for "surely-apart"
against earlier equations of a closed type family.
Flattening means replacing all top-level uses of type functions with
fresh variables, *taking care to preserve sharing*. That is, the type
(Either (F a b) (F a b)) should flatten to (Either c c), never (Either
c d).

Here is a nice example of why it's all necessary:

  type family F a b where
    F Int Bool = Char
    F a   b    = Double
  type family G a         -- open, no instances

How do we reduce (F (G Float) (G Float))? The first equation clearly doesn't match,
while the second equation does. But, before reducing, we must make sure that the
target can never become (F Int Bool). Well, no matter what G Float becomes, it
certainly won't become *both* Int and Bool, so indeed we're safe reducing
(F (G Float) (G Float)) to Double.

This is necessary not only to get more reductions (which we might be
willing to give up on), but for substitutivity. If we have (F x x), we
can see that (F x x) can reduce to Double. So, it had better be the
case that (F blah blah) can reduce to Double, no matter what (blah)
is!  Flattening as done below ensures this.

We also use this flattening operation to check for class instances.
If we have
  instance C (Maybe b)
  instance {-# OVERLAPPING #-} C (Maybe Bool)
  [W] C (Maybe (F a))
we want to know that the second instance might match later. So we
flatten the (F a) in the target before trying to unify with instances.
(This is done in GHC.Core.InstEnv.lookupInstEnv'.)

The algorithm works by building up a TypeMap TyVar, mapping
type family applications to fresh variables. This mapping must
be threaded through all the function calls, as any entry in
the mapping must be propagated to all future nodes in the tree.

The algorithm also must track the set of in-scope variables, in
order to make fresh variables as it flattens. (We are far from a
source of fresh Uniques.) See Wrinkle 2, below.

There are wrinkles, of course:

1. The flattening algorithm must account for the possibility
   of inner `forall`s. (A `forall` seen here can happen only
   because of impredicativity. However, the flattening operation
   is an algorithm in Core, which is impredicative.)
   Suppose we have (forall b. F b) -> (forall b. F b). Of course,
   those two bs are entirely unrelated, and so we should certainly
   not flatten the two calls F b to the same variable. Instead, they
   must be treated separately. We thus carry a substitution that
   freshens variables; we must apply this substitution (in
   `coreFlattenTyFamApp`) before looking up an application in the environment.
   Note that the range of the substitution contains only TyVars, never anything
   else.

   For the sake of efficiency, we only apply this substitution when absolutely
   necessary. Namely:

   * We do not perform the substitution at all if it is empty.
   * We only need to worry about the arguments of a type family that are within
     the arity of said type family, so we can get away with not applying the
     substitution to any oversaturated type family arguments.
   * Importantly, we do /not/ achieve this substitution by recursively
     flattening the arguments, as this would be wrong. Consider `F (G a)`,
     where F and G are type families. We might decide that `F (G a)` flattens
     to `beta`. Later, the substitution is non-empty (but does not map `a`) and
     so we flatten `G a` to `gamma` and try to flatten `F gamma`. Of course,
     `F gamma` is unknown, and so we flatten it to `delta`, but it really
     should have been `beta`! Argh!

     Moral of the story: instead of flattening the arguments, just substitute
     them directly.

2. There are two different reasons we might add a variable
   to the in-scope set as we work:

     A. We have just invented a new flattening variable.
     B. We have entered a `forall`.

   Annoying here is that in-scope variable source (A) must be
   threaded through the calls. For example, consider (F b -> forall c. F c).
   Suppose that, when flattening F b, we invent a fresh variable c.
   Now, when we encounter (forall c. F c), we need to know c is already in
   scope so that we locally rename c to c'. However, if we don't thread through
   the in-scope set from one argument of (->) to the other, we won't know this
   and might get very confused.

   In contrast, source (B) increases only as we go deeper, as in-scope sets
   normally do. However, even here we must be careful. The TypeMap TyVar that
   contains mappings from type family applications to freshened variables will
   be threaded through both sides of (forall b. F b) -> (forall b. F b). We
   thus must make sure that the two `b`s don't get renamed to the same b1. (If
   they did, then looking up `F b1` would yield the same flatten var for
   each.) So, even though `forall`-bound variables should really be in the
   in-scope set only when they are in scope, we retain these variables even
   outside of their scope. This ensures that, if we encounter a fresh
   `forall`-bound b, we will rename it to b2, not b1. Note that keeping a
   larger in-scope set than strictly necessary is always OK, as in-scope sets
   are only ever used to avoid collisions.

   Sadly, the freshening substitution described in (1) really mustn't bind
   variables outside of their scope: note that its domain is the *unrenamed*
   variables. This means that the substitution gets "pushed down" (like a
   reader monad) while the in-scope set gets threaded (like a state monad).
   Because a Subst contains its own in-scope set, we don't carry a Subst;
   instead, we just carry a TvSubstEnv down, tying it to the InScopeSet
   traveling separately as necessary.

3. Consider `F ty_1 ... ty_n`, where F is a type family with arity k:

     type family F ty_1 ... ty_k :: res_k

   It's tempting to just flatten `F ty_1 ... ty_n` to `alpha`, where alpha is a
   flattening skolem. But we must instead flatten it to
   `alpha ty_(k+1) ... ty_n`—that is, by only flattening up to the arity of the
   type family.

   Why is this better? Consider the following concrete example from #16995:

     type family Param :: Type -> Type

     type family LookupParam (a :: Type) :: Type where
       LookupParam (f Char) = Bool
       LookupParam x        = Int

     foo :: LookupParam (Param ())
     foo = 42

   In order for `foo` to typecheck, `LookupParam (Param ())` must reduce to
   `Int`. But if we flatten `Param ()` to `alpha`, then GHC can't be sure if
   `alpha` is apart from `f Char`, so it won't fall through to the second
   equation. But since the `Param` type family has arity 0, we can instead
   flatten `Param ()` to `alpha ()`, about which GHC knows with confidence is
   apart from `f Char`, permitting the second equation to be reached.

   Not only does this allow more programs to be accepted, it's also important
   for correctness. Not doing this was the root cause of the Core Lint error
   in #16995.

flattenTys is defined here because of module dependencies.
