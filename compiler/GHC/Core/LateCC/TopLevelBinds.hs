{- Note [Collecting late cost centres]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usually cost centres defined by a module are collected
during tidy by collectCostCentres. However with `-fprof-late`
we insert cost centres after inlining. So we keep a list of
all the cost centres we inserted and combine that with the list
of cost centres found during tidy.

To avoid overhead when using -fprof-inline there is a flag to stop
us from collecting them here when we run this pass before tidy.

Note [Adding late cost centres to top level bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basic idea is very simple. For a top level binder
`f = rhs` we compile it as if the user had written
`f = {-# SCC f #-} rhs`.

If we do this after unfoldings for `f` have been created this
doesn't impact core-level optimizations at all. If we do it
before the cost centre will be included in the unfolding and
might inhibit optimizations at the call site. For this reason
we provide flags for both approaches as they have different
tradeoffs.

To reduce overhead we ignore workfree bindings because they don't contribute
meaningfully to a performance profile. This reduces code size massively as it
allows us to allocate definitions like `val = Just 32` at compile time instead
of turning them into a CAF of the form `val = <scc val> let x = Just 32 in x` which
would be the alternative.

We make an exception for rhss with function types. This allows us to get
cost centres on eta-reduced definitions like `f = g`. By putting a tick onto
`f`s rhs we end up with

    f = \eta1 eta2 ... etan ->
        <scc f> g eta1 ... etan

Which can make it easier to understand call graphs of an application.

We also don't add a cost centre for any binder that is a constructor
worker or wrapper. These will never meaningfully enrich the resulting
profile so we improve efficiency by omitting those.
