Note [Expanding newtypes and products]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When expanding a type to expose a data-type constructor, we need to be
careful about newtypes, lest we fall into an infinite loop. Here are
the key examples:

  newtype Id  x = MkId x
  newtype Fix f = MkFix (f (Fix f))
  newtype T     = MkT (T -> T)

  Type           Expansion
 --------------------------
  T              T -> T
  Fix Maybe      Maybe (Fix Maybe)
  Id (Id Int)    Int
  Fix Id         NO NO NO

Notice that
 * We can expand T, even though it's recursive.
 * We can expand Id (Id Int), even though the Id shows up
   twice at the outer level, because Id is non-recursive

So, when expanding, we keep track of when we've seen a recursive
newtype at outermost level; and bail out if we see it again.

We sometimes want to do the same for product types, so that the
strictness analyser doesn't unbox infinitely deeply.

More precisely, we keep a *count* of how many times we've seen it.
This is to account for
   data instance T (a,b) = MkT (T a) (T b)
Then (#10482) if we have a type like
        T (Int,(Int,(Int,(Int,Int))))
we can still unbox deeply enough during strictness analysis.
We have to treat T as potentially recursive, but it's still
good to be able to unwrap multiple layers.

The function that manages all this is checkRecTc.
