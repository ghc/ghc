This is the syntax for types as seen in type signatures.

Note [HsBSig binder lists]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a binder (or pattern) decorated with a type or kind,
   \ (x :: a -> a). blah
   forall (a :: k -> *) (b :: k). blah
Then we use a LHsBndrSig on the binder, so that the
renamer can decorate it with the variables bound
by the pattern ('a' in the first example, 'k' in the second),
assuming that neither of them is in scope already
See also Note [Kind and type-variable binders] in GHC.Rename.HsType

Note [HsType binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system for recording type and kind-variable binders in HsTypes
is a bit complicated.  Here's how it works.

* In a HsType,
     HsForAllTy   represents an /explicit, user-written/ 'forall'
                   e.g.   forall a b.   {...} or
                          forall a b -> {...}
     HsQualTy     represents an /explicit, user-written/ context
                   e.g.   (Eq a, Show a) => ...
                  The context can be empty if that's what the user wrote
  These constructors represent what the user wrote, no more
  and no less.

* The ForAllTelescope field of HsForAllTy represents whether a forall is
  invisible (e.g., forall a b. {...}, with a dot) or visible
  (e.g., forall a b -> {...}, with an arrow).

* HsTyVarBndr describes a quantified type variable written by the
  user.  For example
     f :: forall a (b :: *).  blah
  here 'a' and '(b::*)' are each a HsTyVarBndr.  A HsForAllTy has
  a list of LHsTyVarBndrs.

* HsImplicitBndrs is a wrapper that gives the implicitly-quantified
  kind and type variables of the wrapped thing.  It is filled in by
  the renamer. For example, if the user writes
     f :: a -> a
  the HsImplicitBinders binds the 'a' (not a HsForAllTy!).
  NB: this implicit quantification is purely lexical: we bind any
      type or kind variables that are not in scope. The type checker
      may subsequently quantify over further kind variables.

* HsWildCardBndrs is a wrapper that binds the wildcard variables
  of the wrapped thing.  It is filled in by the renamer
     f :: _a -> _
  The enclosing HsWildCardBndrs binds the wildcards _a and _.

* HsSigPatType describes types that appear in pattern signatures and
  the signatures of term-level binders in RULES. Like
  HsWildCardBndrs/HsImplicitBndrs, they track the names of wildcard
  variables and implicitly bound type variables. Unlike
  HsImplicitBndrs, however, HsSigPatTypes do not obey the
  forall-or-nothing rule. See Note [Pattern signature binders and scoping].

* The explicit presence of these wrappers specifies, in the HsSyn,
  exactly where implicit quantification is allowed, and where
  wildcards are allowed.

* LHsQTyVars is used in data/class declarations, where the user gives
  explicit *type* variable bindings, but we need to implicitly bind
  *kind* variables.  For example
      class C (a :: k -> *) where ...
  The 'k' is implicitly bound in the hsq_tvs field of LHsQTyVars

Note [The wildcard story for types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Types can have wildcards in them, to support partial type signatures,
like       f :: Int -> (_ , _a) -> _a

A wildcard in a type can be

  * An anonymous wildcard,
        written '_'
    In HsType this is represented by HsWildCardTy.
    The renamer leaves it untouched, and it is later given a fresh
    meta tyvar in the typechecker.

  * A named wildcard,
        written '_a', '_foo', etc
    In HsType this is represented by (HsTyVar "_a")
    i.e. a perfectly ordinary type variable that happens
         to start with an underscore

Note carefully:

* When NamedWildCards is off, type variables that start with an
  underscore really /are/ ordinary type variables.  And indeed, even
  when NamedWildCards is on you can bind _a explicitly as an ordinary
  type variable:
        data T _a _b = MkT _b _a
  Or even:
        f :: forall _a. _a -> _b
  Here _a is an ordinary forall'd binder, but (With NamedWildCards)
  _b is a named wildcard.  (See the comments in #10982)

* Named wildcards are bound by the HsWildCardBndrs (for types that obey the
  forall-or-nothing rule) and HsPatSigType (for type signatures in patterns
  and term-level binders in RULES), which wrap types that are allowed to have
  wildcards. Unnamed wildcards, however are left unchanged until typechecking,
  where we give them fresh wild tyvars and determine whether or not to emit
  hole constraints on each wildcard (we don't if it's a visible type/kind
  argument or a type family pattern). See related notes
  Note [Wildcards in visible kind application] and
  Note [Wildcards in visible type application] in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.

* After type checking is done, we report what types the wildcards
  got unified with.

Note [Ordering of implicit variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the advent of -XTypeApplications, GHC makes promises about the ordering
of implicit variable quantification. Specifically, we offer that implicitly
quantified variables (such as those in const :: a -> b -> a, without a `forall`)
will occur in left-to-right order of first occurrence. Here are a few examples:

  const :: a -> b -> a       -- forall a b. ...
  f :: Eq a => b -> a -> a   -- forall a b. ...  contexts are included

  type a <-< b = b -> a
  g :: a <-< b               -- forall a b. ...  type synonyms matter

  class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b   -- forall f a b. ...
    -- The f is quantified by the class, so only a and b are considered in fmap

This simple story is complicated by the possibility of dependency: all variables
must come after any variables mentioned in their kinds.

  typeRep :: Typeable a => TypeRep (a :: k)   -- forall k a. ...

The k comes first because a depends on k, even though the k appears later than
the a in the code. Thus, GHC does a *stable topological sort* on the variables.
By "stable", we mean that any two variables who do not depend on each other
preserve their existing left-to-right ordering.

Implicitly bound variables are collected by the extract- family of functions
(extractHsTysRdrTyVars, extractHsTyVarBndrsKVs, etc.) in GHC.Rename.HsType.
These functions thus promise to keep left-to-right ordering.
Look for pointers to this note to see the places where the action happens.

Note that we also maintain this ordering in kind signatures. Even though
there's no visible kind application (yet), having implicit variables be
quantified in left-to-right order in kind signatures is nice since:

* It's consistent with the treatment for type signatures.
* It can affect how types are displayed with -fprint-explicit-kinds (see
  #15568 for an example), which is a situation where knowing the order in
  which implicit variables are quantified can be useful.
* In the event that visible kind application is implemented, the order in
  which we would expect implicit variables to be ordered in kinds will have
  already been established.

{- Note [Representing type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HsSigType is used to represent an explicit user type signature
such as   f :: a -> a
     or   g (x :: a -> a) = x

A HsSigType is just a HsImplicitBndrs wrapping a LHsType.
 * The HsImplicitBndrs binds the /implicitly/ quantified tyvars
 * The LHsType binds the /explicitly/ quantified tyvars

E.g. For a signature like
   f :: forall (a::k). blah
we get
   HsIB { hsib_vars = [k]
        , hsib_body = HsForAllTy { hst_tele = HsForAllInvis [(a::*)]
                                 , hst_body = blah }
The implicit kind variable 'k' is bound by the HsIB;
the explicitly forall'd tyvar 'a' is bound by the HsForAllTy

Note [Pattern signature binders and scoping]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the pattern signatures like those on `t` and `g` in:

   f = let h = \(t :: (b, b) ->
               \(g :: forall a. a -> b) ->
               ...(t :: (Int,Int))...
       in woggle

* The `b` in t's pattern signature is implicitly bound and scopes over
  the signature and the body of the lambda.  It stands for a type (any type);
  indeed we subsequently discover that b=Int.
  (See Note [TyVarTv] in GHC.Tc.Utils.TcMType for more on this point.)
* The `b` in g's pattern signature is an /occurrence/ of the `b` bound by
  t's pattern signature.
* The `a` in `forall a` scopes only over the type `a -> b`, not over the body
  of the lambda.
* There is no forall-or-nothing rule for pattern signatures, which is why the
  type `forall a. a -> b` is permitted in `g`'s pattern signature, even though
  `b` is not explicitly bound.
  See Note [forall-or-nothing rule] in GHC.Rename.HsType.

Similar scoping rules apply to term variable binders in RULES, like in the
following example:

   {-# RULES "h" forall (t :: (b, b)) (g :: forall a. a -> b). h t g = ... #-}

Just like in pattern signatures, the `b` in t's signature is implicitly bound
and scopes over the remainder of the RULE. As a result, the `b` in g's
signature is an occurrence. Moreover, the `a` in `forall a` scopes only over
the type `a -> b`, and the forall-or-nothing rule does not apply.

While quite similar, RULE term binder signatures behave slightly differently
from pattern signatures in two ways:

1. Unlike in pattern signatures, where type variables can stand for any type,
   type variables in RULE term binder signatures are skolems.
   See Note [Typechecking pattern signature binders] in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType for
   more on this point.

   In this sense, type variables in pattern signatures are quite similar to
   named wildcards, as both can refer to arbitrary types. The main difference
   lies in error reporting: if a named wildcard `_a` in a pattern signature
   stands for Int, then by default GHC will emit a warning stating as much.
   Changing `_a` to `a`, on the other hand, will cause it not to be reported.
2. In the `h` RULE above, only term variables are explicitly bound, so any free
   type variables in the term variables' signatures are implicitly bound.
   This is just like how the free type variables in pattern signatures are
   implicitly bound. If a RULE explicitly binds both term and type variables,
   however, then free type variables in term signatures are /not/ implicitly
   bound. For example, this RULE would be ill scoped:

     {-# RULES "h2" forall b. forall (t :: (b, c)) (g :: forall a. a -> b).
                    h2 t g = ... #-}

   This is because `b` and `c` occur free in the signature for `t`, but only
   `b` was explicitly bound, leaving `c` out of scope. If the RULE had started
   with `forall b c.`, then it would have been accepted.

The types in pattern signatures and RULE term binder signatures are represented
in the AST by HsSigPatType. From the renamer onward, the hsps_ext field (of
type HsPSRn) tracks the names of named wildcards and implicitly bound type
variables so that they can be brought into scope during renaming and
typechecking.

Note [Unit tuples]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the type
    type instance F Int = ()
We want to parse that "()"
    as HsTupleTy HsBoxedOrConstraintTuple [],
NOT as HsTyVar unitTyCon

Why? Because F might have kind (* -> Constraint), so we when parsing we
don't know if that tuple is going to be a constraint tuple or an ordinary
unit tuple.  The HsTupleSort flag is specifically designed to deal with
that, but it has to work for unit tuples too.

Note [Promotions (HsTyVar)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HsTyVar: A name in a type or kind.
  Here are the allowed namespaces for the name.
    In a type:
      Var: not allowed
      Data: promoted data constructor
      Tv: type variable
      TcCls before renamer: type constructor, class constructor, or promoted data constructor
      TcCls after renamer: type constructor or class constructor
    In a kind:
      Var, Data: not allowed
      Tv: kind variable
      TcCls: kind constructor or promoted type constructor

  The 'Promoted' field in an HsTyVar captures whether the type was promoted in
  the source code by prefixing an apostrophe.

Note [HsStarTy]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the StarIsType extension is enabled, we want to treat '*' and its Unicode
variant identically to 'Data.Kind.Type'. Unfortunately, doing so in the parser
would mean that when we pretty-print it back, we don't know whether the user
wrote '*' or 'Type', and lose the parse/ppr roundtrip property.

As a workaround, we parse '*' as HsStarTy (if it stands for 'Data.Kind.Type')
and then desugar it to 'Data.Kind.Type' in the typechecker (see tc_hs_type).
When '*' is a regular type operator (StarIsType is disabled), HsStarTy is not
involved.


Note [Promoted lists and tuples]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notice the difference between
   HsListTy    HsExplicitListTy
   HsTupleTy   HsExplicitListTupleTy

E.g.    f :: [Int]                      HsListTy

        g3  :: T '[]                   All these use
        g2  :: T '[True]                  HsExplicitListTy
        g1  :: T '[True,False]
        g1a :: T [True,False]             (can omit ' where unambiguous)

  kind of T :: [Bool] -> *        This kind uses HsListTy!

E.g.    h :: (Int,Bool)                 HsTupleTy; f is a pair
        k :: S '(True,False)            HsExplicitTypleTy; S is indexed by
                                           a type-level pair of booleans
        kind of S :: (Bool,Bool) -> *   This kind uses HsExplicitTupleTy

Note [Distinguishing tuple kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apart from promotion, tuples can have one of three different kinds:

        x :: (Int, Bool)                -- Regular boxed tuples
        f :: Int# -> (# Int#, Int# #)   -- Unboxed tuples
        g :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a         -- Constraint tuples

For convenience, internally we use a single constructor for all of these,
namely HsTupleTy, but keep track of the tuple kind (in the first argument to
HsTupleTy, a HsTupleSort). We can tell if a tuple is unboxed while parsing,
because of the #. However, with -XConstraintKinds we can only distinguish
between constraint and boxed tuples during type checking, in general. Hence the
four constructors of HsTupleSort:

        HsUnboxedTuple                  -> Produced by the parser
        HsBoxedTuple                    -> Certainly a boxed tuple
        HsConstraintTuple               -> Certainly a constraint tuple
        HsBoxedOrConstraintTuple        -> Could be a boxed or a constraint
                                        tuple. Produced by the parser only,
                                        disappears after type checking

Note [ConDeclField passs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ConDeclField contains a list of field occurrences: these always
include the field label as the user wrote it.  After the renamer, it
will additionally contain the identity of the selector function in the
second component.

Due to DuplicateRecordFields, the OccName of the selector function
may have been mangled, which is why we keep the original field label
separately.  For example, when DuplicateRecordFields is enabled

    data T = MkT { x :: Int }

gives

    ConDeclField { cd_fld_names = [L _ (FieldOcc "x" $sel:x:MkT)], ... }.

although there is no explicit forall, the "_a" scopes over the definition.
I don't know if this is a good idea, but there it is.
-}

{- Note [hsScopedTvs vis_flag]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-XScopedTypeVariables can be defined in terms of a desugaring to
-XTypeAbstractions (GHC Proposal #50):

    fn :: forall a b c. tau(a,b,c)            fn :: forall a b c. tau(a,b,c)
    fn = defn(a,b,c)                   ==>    fn @x @y @z = defn(x,y,z)

That is, for every type variable of the leading 'forall' in the type signature,
we add an invisible binder at term level.

This model does not extend to visible forall, as discussed here:

* https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/16734#note_203412
* https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/238

The conclusion of these discussions can be summarized as follows:

  > Assuming support for visible 'forall' in terms, consider this example:
  >
  >     vfn :: forall x y -> tau(x,y)
  >     vfn = \a b -> ...
  >
  > The user has written their own binders 'a' and 'b' to stand for 'x' and
  > 'y', and we definitely should not desugar this into:
  >
  >     vfn :: forall x y -> tau(x,y)
  >     vfn x y = \a b -> ...         -- bad!

We cement this design by pattern-matching on HsForAllInvis in hsScopedTvs:

    hsScopedTvs (HsForAllTy { hst_tele = HsForAllInvis { hst_bndrs = ... }
                            , ... }) = ...

At the moment, GHC does not support visible 'forall' in terms. Nevertheless,
it is still possible to write erroneous programs that use visible 'forall's in
terms, such as this example:

    x :: forall a -> a -> a
    x = x

If we do not pattern-match on HsForAllInvis in hsScopedTvs, then `a` would
erroneously be brought into scope over the body of `x` when renaming it.
Although the typechecker would later reject this (see `GHC.Tc.Validity.vdqAllowed`),
it is still possible for this to wreak havoc in the renamer before it gets to
that point (see #17687 for an example of this).
Bottom line: nip problems in the bud by matching on HsForAllInvis from the start.

Note [No nested foralls or contexts in instance types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The type at the top of an instance declaration is one of the few places in GHC
where nested `forall`s or contexts are not permitted, even with RankNTypes
enabled. For example, the following will be rejected:

  instance forall a. forall b. Show (Either a b) where ...
  instance Eq a => Eq b => Show (Either a b) where ...
  instance (forall a. Show (Maybe a)) where ...
  instance (Eq a => Show (Maybe a)) where ...

This restriction is partly motivated by an unusual quirk of instance
declarations. Namely, if ScopedTypeVariables is enabled, then the type
variables from the top of an instance will scope over the bodies of the
instance methods, /even if the type variables are implicitly quantified/.
For example, GHC will accept the following:

  instance Monoid a => Monoid (Identity a) where
    mempty = Identity (mempty @a)

Moreover, the type in the top of an instance declaration must obey the
forall-or-nothing rule (see Note [forall-or-nothing rule] in
GHC.Rename.HsType). If instance types allowed nested `forall`s, this could
result in some strange interactions. For example, consider the following:

  class C a where
    m :: Proxy a
  instance (forall a. C (Either a b)) where
    m = Proxy @(Either a b)

Somewhat surprisingly, old versions of GHC would accept the instance above.
Even though the `forall` only quantifies `a`, the outermost parentheses mean
that the `forall` is nested, and per the forall-or-nothing rule, this means
that implicit quantification would occur. Therefore, the `a` is explicitly
bound and the `b` is implicitly bound. Moreover, ScopedTypeVariables would
bring /both/ sorts of type variables into scope over the body of `m`.
How utterly confusing!

To avoid this sort of confusion, we simply disallow nested `forall`s in
instance types, which makes things like the instance above become illegal.
For the sake of consistency, we also disallow nested contexts, even though they
don't have the same strange interaction with ScopedTypeVariables.

-----
-- Wrinkle: Derived instances
-----

`deriving` clauses and standalone `deriving` declarations also permit bringing
type variables into scope, either through explicit or implicit quantification.
Unlike in the tops of instance declarations, however, one does not need to
enable ScopedTypeVariables for this to take effect.

Just as GHC forbids nested `forall`s in the top of instance declarations, it
also forbids them in types involved with `deriving`:

1. In the `via` types in DerivingVia. For example, this is rejected:

     deriving via (forall x. V x) instance C (S x)

   Just like the types in instance declarations, `via` types can also bring
   both implicitly and explicitly bound type variables into scope. As a result,
   we adopt the same no-nested-`forall`s rule in `via` types to avoid confusing
   behavior like in the example below:

     deriving via (forall x. T x y) instance W x y (Foo a b)
     -- Both x and y are brought into scope???
2. In the classes in `deriving` clauses. For example, this is rejected:

     data T = MkT deriving (C1, (forall x. C2 x y))

   This is because the generated instance would look like:

     instance forall x y. C2 x y T where ...

   So really, the same concerns as instance declarations apply here as well.

Note [Printing KindedTyVars]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#3830 reminded me that we should really only print the kind
signature on a KindedTyVar if the kind signature was put there by the
programmer.  During kind inference GHC now adds a PostTcKind to UserTyVars,
rather than converting to KindedTyVars as before.

(As it happens, the message in #3830 comes out a different way now,
and the problem doesn't show up; but having the flag on a KindedTyVar
seems like the Right Thing anyway.)
