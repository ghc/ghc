{- Note [SRTs]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
Static Reference Tables (SRTs) are the mechanism by which the garbage collector
can determine the live CAFs in the program. An SRT is a static table associated
with a CAFfy closure which record which CAFfy objects are reachable from
the closure's code.

Representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| info |
|      |     +-----+---+---+---+

|------|     +-----+-|-+-|-+---+

|      |             v   v

An SRT is simply an object in the program's data segment. It has the
same representation as a static constructor.  There are 16
pre-compiled SRT info tables: stg_SRT_1_info, .. stg_SRT_16_info,
representing SRT objects with 1-16 pointers, respectively.

The entries of an SRT object point to static closures, which are either
- FUN_STATIC, THUNK_STATIC or CONSTR
- Another SRT (actually just a CONSTR)

The final field of the SRT is the static link field, used by the
garbage collector to chain together static closures that it visits and
to determine whether a static closure has been visited or not. (see
Note [STATIC_LINK fields])

By traversing the transitive closure of an SRT, the GC will reach all
of the CAFs that are reachable from the code associated with this SRT.

If we need to create an SRT with more than 16 entries, we build a
chain of SRT objects with all but the last having 16 entries.

Referring to an SRT from the info table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following things have SRTs:

- Static functions (FUN)
- Static thunks (THUNK), ie. CAFs
- Continuations (RET_SMALL, etc.)

In each case, the info table points to the SRT, if there is one.

- info->srt is 0 if there's no SRT
- otherwise, there are three ways which we may encode the location of the SRT in
  the info table, described below.

USE_SRT_POINTER
---------------
Most general implementation. Can always be used, but other ways are more efficient.

- info->srt is a pointer

We encode an **absolute pointer** to the SRT in info->srt. e.g. for a FUN
with an SRT:

StgInfoTable          +------+
  info->layout.ptrs   | ...  |
  info->layout.nptrs  | ...  |
  info->srt           |  ------------> pointer to SRT object
  info->type          | ...  |
                      |------|

USE_SRT_OFFSET
--------------
Requires:
  - tables-next-to-code enabled

In this case we use the info->srt to encode whether or not there is an SRT and
if so encode the offset to its location in info->f.srt_offset:

- info->srt is a half-word
- info->f.srt_offset is a 32-bit int
- info->srt is 0 if there's no SRT, otherwise,
- info->srt == 1 and info->f.srt_offset is a offset to the SRT, relative to the
field address itself

e.g. for a FUN with an SRT:

StgFunInfoTable       +------+
  info->f.srt_offset  |  ------------> offset to SRT object
StgInfoTable          +------+
  info->layout.ptrs   | ...  |
  info->layout.nptrs  | ...  |
  info->srt           |  1   |
  info->type          | ...  |
                      |------|

USE_INLINE_SRT_FIELD
--------------------
Requires:
  - tables-next-to-code enabled
  - 64-bit architecture
  - small memory model

We optimise the info table representation further.  The offset to the SRT can
be stored in 32 bits (all code lives within a 2GB region in x86_64's small
memory model), so we can save a word in the info table by storing the
srt_offset in the srt field, which is half a word.

- info->srt is a half-word
- info->srt is 0 if there's no SRT, otherwise:
- info->srt is an offset from the info pointer to the SRT object

StgInfoTable          +------+
  info->layout.ptrs   |      |
  info->layout.nptrs  |      |
  info->srt           |  ------------> offset to SRT object
                      |------|


EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

f = \x. ... g ...
  where
    g = \y. ... h ... c1 ...
    h = \z. ... c2 ...

c1 & c2 are CAFs

g and h are local functions, but they have no static closures.  When
we generate code for f, we start with a CmmGroup of four CmmDecls:

   [ f_closure, f_entry, g_entry, h_entry ]

we process each CmmDecl separately in cpsTop, giving us a list of
CmmDecls. e.g. for f_entry, we might end up with

   [ f_entry, f1_ret, f2_proc ]

where f1_ret is a return point, and f2_proc is a proc-point.  We have
a CAFSet for each of these CmmDecls, let's suppose they are

   [ f_entry{g_info}, f1_ret{g_info}, f2_proc{} ]
   [ g_entry{h_info, c1_closure} ]
   [ h_entry{c2_closure} ]

Next, we make an SRT for each of these functions:

  f_srt : [g_info]
  g_srt : [h_info, c1_closure]
  h_srt : [c2_closure]

Now, for g_info and h_info, we want to refer to the SRTs for g and h
respectively, which we'll label g_srt and h_srt:

  f_srt : [g_srt]
  g_srt : [h_srt, c1_closure]
  h_srt : [c2_closure]

Now, when an SRT has a single entry, we don't actually generate an SRT
closure for it, instead we just replace references to it with its
single element.  So, since h_srt == c2_closure, we have

  f_srt : [g_srt]
  g_srt : [c2_closure, c1_closure]
  h_srt : [c2_closure]

and the only SRT closure we generate is

  g_srt = SRT_2 [c2_closure, c1_closure]

Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

0. let srtMap :: Map CAFfyLabel (Maybe SRTEntry) = {}
   Maps closures to their SRT entries (i.e. how they appear in a SRT payload)

1. Start with decls :: [CmmDecl]. This corresponds to an SCC of bindings in STG
   after code-generation.

2. CPS-convert each CmmDecl (GHC.Cmm.Pipeline.cpsTop), resulting in a list
   [CmmDecl]. There might be multiple CmmDecls in the result, due to proc-point
   splitting.

3. In cpsTop, *before* proc-point splitting, when we still have a single
   CmmDecl, we do cafAnal for procs:

   * cafAnal performs a backwards analysis on the code blocks

   * For each labelled block, the analysis produces a CAFSet (= Set CAFfyLabel),
     representing all the CAFfyLabels reachable from this label.

   * A label is added to the set if it refers to a FUN, THUNK, or RET,
     and its CafInfo /= NoCafRefs.
     (NB. all CafInfo for Ids in the current module should be initialised to
     MayHaveCafRefs)

   * The result is CAFEnv = LabelMap CAFSet

   (Why *before* proc-point splitting? Because the analysis needs to propagate
   information across branches, and proc-point splitting turns branches into
   CmmCalls to top-level CmmDecls.  The analysis would fail to find all the
   references to CAFFY labels if we did it after proc-point splitting.)

   For static data, cafAnalData simply returns set of all labels that refer to a
   FUN, THUNK, and RET whose CafInfos /= NoCafRefs.

4. The result of cpsTop is (CAFEnv, [CmmDecl]) for procs and (CAFSet, CmmDecl)
   for static data. So after `mapM cpsTop decls` we have
   [Either (CAFEnv, [CmmDecl]) (CAFSet, CmmDecl)]

5. For procs concat the decls and union the CAFEnvs to get (CAFEnv, [CmmDecl])

6. For static data generate a Map CLabel CAFSet (maps static data to their CAFSets)

7. Dependency-analyse the decls using CAFEnv and CAFSets, giving us SCC CAFfyLabel

8. For each SCC in dependency order
   - Let lbls :: [CAFfyLabel] be the non-recursive labels in this SCC
   - Apply CAFEnv to each label and concat the result :: [CAFfyLabel]
   - For each CAFfyLabel in the set apply srtMap (and ignore Nothing) to get
     srt :: [SRTEntry]
   - Make a label for this SRT, call it l
   - If the SRT is not empty (i.e. the group is CAFFY) add FUN_STATICs in the
     group to the SRT (see Note [Invalid optimisation: shortcutting])
   - Add to srtMap: lbls -> if null srt then Nothing else Just l

9. At the end, update the IdInfo for every top-level binding x:
   if srtMap x == Nothing, then the binding is non-CAFFY, otherwise it is
   CAFFY.

Optimisations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To reduce the code size overhead and the cost of traversing SRTs in
the GC, we want to simplify SRTs where possible. We therefore apply
the following optimisations.  Each has a [keyword]; search for the
keyword in the code below to see where the optimisation is
implemented.

1. [Inline] we never create an SRT with a single entry, instead we
   point to the single entry directly from the info table.

   i.e. instead of

    +------+
    | info |
    |      |     +-----+---+---+
    |   -------->|SRT_1| | | 0 |
    |------|     +-----+-|-+---+
    |      |             |
    | code |             |
    |      |             v
                         C

   we can point directly to the closure:

    +------+
    | info |
    |      |
    |   -------->C
    |------|
    |      |
    | code |
    |      |


   Furthermore, the SRT for any code that refers to this info table
   can point directly to C.

   The exception to this is when we're doing dynamic linking. In that
   case, if the closure is not locally defined then we can't point to
   it directly from the info table, because this is the text section
   which cannot contain runtime relocations. In this case we skip this
   optimisation and generate the singleton SRT, because SRTs are in the
   data section and *can* have relocatable references.

2. [FUN] A static function closure can also be an SRT, we simply put
   the SRT entries as fields in the static closure.  This makes a lot
   of sense: the static references are just like the free variables of
   the FUN closure.

   i.e. instead of

   f_closure:
   +-----+---+
   |  |  | 0 |
   +- |--+---+
      |            +------+
      |            | info |     f_srt:
      |            |      |     +-----+---+---+---+
      |            |   -------->|SRT_2| | | | + 0 |
      `----------->|------|     +-----+-|-+-|-+---+
                   |      |             |   |
                   | code |             |   |
                   |      |             v   v


   We can generate:

   f_closure:
   +-----+---+---+---+
   |  |  | | | | | 0 |
   +- |--+-|-+-|-+---+
      |    |   |   +------+
      |    v   v   | info |
      |            |      |
      |            |   0  |
      `----------->|------|
                   |      |
                   | code |
                   |      |


   (note: we can't do this for THUNKs, because the thunk gets
   overwritten when it is entered, so we wouldn't be able to share
   this SRT with other info tables that want to refer to it (see
   [Common] below). FUNs are immutable so don't have this problem.)

3. [Common] Identical SRTs can be commoned up.

4. [Filter] If an SRT A refers to an SRT B and a closure C, and B also
   refers to C (perhaps transitively), then we can omit the reference
   to C from A.


Note that there are many other optimisations that we could do, but
aren't implemented. In general, we could omit any reference from an
SRT if everything reachable from it is also reachable from the other
fields in the SRT. Our [Filter] optimisation is a special case of
this.

Another opportunity we don't exploit is this:

A = {X,Y,Z}
B = {Y,Z}
C = {X,B}

Here we could use C = {A} and therefore [Inline] C = A.

Note [No static object resurrection]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The "static flag" mechanism (see Note [STATIC_LINK fields] in smStorage.h) that
the GC uses to track liveness of static objects assumes that unreachable
objects will never become reachable again (i.e. are never "resurrected").
Breaking this assumption can result in extremely subtle GC soundness issues
(e.g. #15544, #20959).

Guaranteeing that this assumption is not violated requires that all CAFfy
static objects reachable from the object's code are reachable from its SRT.  In
the past we have gotten this wrong in a few ways:

 * shortcutting references to FUN_STATICs to instead point to the FUN_STATIC's
   SRT. This lead to #15544 and is described in more detail in Note [Invalid
   optimisation: shortcutting].

 * omitting references to static data constructor applications. This previously
   happened due to an oversight (#20959): when generating an SRT for a
   recursive group we would drop references to the CAFfy static data
   constructors.

To see why we cannot allow object resurrection, see the examples in the
above-mentioned Notes.

If a static closure definitely does not transitively refer to any CAFs, then it
*may* be advertised as not-CAFfy in the interface file and consequently *may*
be omitted from SRTs. Regardless of whether the closure is advertised as CAFfy
or non-CAFfy, its STATIC_LINK field *must* be set to 3, so that it never
appears on the static closure list.
-}

{-
Note [Invalid optimisation: shortcutting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might think that if we have something like

A's SRT = {B}
B's SRT = {X}

that we could replace the reference to B in A's SRT with X.

A's SRT = {X}
B's SRT = {X}

and thereby perhaps save a little work at runtime, because we don't
have to visit B.

But this is NOT valid.

Consider these cases:

0. B can't be a constructor, because constructors don't have SRTs

1. B is a CAF. This is the easy one. Obviously we want A's SRT to
   point to B, so that it keeps B alive.

2. B is a function.  This is the tricky one. The reason we can't
   shortcut in this case is that we aren't allowed to resurrect static
   objects for the reason described in Note [No static object resurrection].
   We noticed this in #15544.

The particular case that cropped up when we tried this in #15544 was:

- A is a thunk
- B is a static function
- X is a CAF
- suppose we GC when A is alive, and B is not otherwise reachable.
- B is "collected", meaning that it doesn't make it onto the static
  objects list during this GC, but nothing bad happens yet.
- Next, suppose we enter A, and then call B. (remember that A refers to B)
  At the entry point to B, we GC. This puts B on the stack, as part of the
  RET_FUN stack frame that gets pushed when we GC at a function entry point.
- This GC will now reach B
- But because B was previous "collected", it breaks the assumption
  that static objects are never resurrected. See Note [STATIC_LINK
  fields] in rts/sm/Storage.h for why this is bad.
- In practice, the GC thinks that B has already been visited, and so
  doesn't visit X, and catastrophe ensues.


Note [Ticky labels in SRT analysis]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Raw Cmm data (CmmStaticsRaw) can't contain pointers so they're considered
non-CAFFY in SRT analysis and we update the SRTMap mapping them to `Nothing`
(meaning they're not CAFFY).

However when building with -ticky we generate ticky CLabels using the function's
`Name`. For example, if we have a top-level function `sat_s1rQ`, in a ticky
build we get two IdLabels using the name `sat_s1rQ`:

- For the function itself: IdLabel sat_s1rQ ... Entry
- For the ticky counter: IdLabel sat_s1rQ ... RednCounts

In these cases we really want to use the function definition for the SRT
analysis of this Name, because that's what we export for this Name -- ticky
counters are not exported. So we ignore ticky counters in SRT analysis (which
are never CAFFY and never exported).

Not doing this caused #17947 where we analysed the function first mapped the
name to CAFFY. We then saw the ticky constructor, and because it has the same
Name as the function and is not CAFFY we overrode the CafInfo of the name as
non-CAFFY.

-- Constructing SRTs

{- Implementation notes

- In each CmmDecl there is a mapping info_tbls from Label -> CmmInfoTable

- The entry in info_tbls corresponding to g_entry is the closure info
  table, the rest are continuations.

- Each entry in info_tbls possibly needs an SRT.  We need to make a
  label for each of these.

- We get the CAFSet for each entry from the CAFEnv

{- Note [recursive SRTs]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the dependency analyser has found us a recursive group of
declarations, then we build a single SRT for the whole group, on the
grounds that everything in the group is reachable from everything
else, so we lose nothing by having a single SRT.

However, there are a couple of wrinkles to be aware of.

* The Set CAFfyLabel for this SRT will contain labels in the group
  itself. The SRTMap will therefore not contain entries for these labels
  yet, so we can't turn them into SRTEntries using resolveCAF. BUT we
  can just remove recursive references from the Set CAFLabel before
  generating the SRT - the group SRT will consist of the union of the SRTs of
  each of group's constituents minus recursive references.

* That is, EXCEPT for static function closures and static data constructor
  applications. For the same reason described in Note [No static object
  resurrection], we cannot omit references to static function closures and
  constructor applications.

  But, since we will merge the SRT with one of the static function
  closures (see [FUN]), we can omit references to *that* static
  function closure from the SRT.

* Similarly, we must reintroduce recursive references to static data
  constructor applications into the group's SRT.
