-- Note [Cmm Switches, the general plan]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Compiling a high-level switch statement, as it comes out of a STG case
-- expression, for example, allows for a surprising amount of design decisions.
-- Therefore, we cleanly separated this from the Stg → Cmm transformation, as
-- well as from the actual code generation.
--
-- The overall plan is:
--  * The Stg → Cmm transformation creates a single `SwitchTargets` in
--    emitSwitch and emitCmmLitSwitch in GHC.StgToCmm.Utils.
--    At this stage, they are unsuitable for code generation.
--  * A dedicated Cmm transformation (GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement) replaces these
--    switch statements with code that is suitable for code generation, i.e.
--    a nice balanced tree of decisions with dense jump tables in the leafs.
--    The actual planning of this tree is performed in pure code in createSwitchPlan
--    in this module. See Note [createSwitchPlan].
--  * The actual code generation will not do any further processing and
--    implement each CmmSwitch with a jump tables.
--
-- When compiling to LLVM or C, GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement leaves the switch
-- statements alone, as we can turn a SwitchTargets value into a nice
-- switch-statement in LLVM resp. C, and leave the rest to the compiler.
--
-- See Note [GHC.Cmm.Switch vs. GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement] why the two module are
-- separated.


-- Note [Magic Constants in GHC.Cmm.Switch]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- There are a lot of heuristics here that depend on magic values where it is
-- hard to determine the "best" value (for whatever that means). These are the
-- magic values:

-- | Number of consecutive default values allowed in a jump table. If there are
-- more of them, the jump tables are split.
--
-- Currently 7, as it costs 7 words of additional code when a jump table is
-- split (at least on x64, determined experimentally).
maxJumpTableHole :: Integer
maxJumpTableHole = 7

-- | Minimum size of a jump table. If the number is smaller, the switch is
-- implemented using conditionals.
-- Currently 5, because an if-then-else tree of 4 values is nice and compact.
minJumpTableSize :: Int
minJumpTableSize = 5

-- | Minimum non-zero offset for a jump table. See Note [Jump Table Offset].
minJumpTableOffset :: Integer
minJumpTableOffset = 2


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Switch Targets

-- Note [SwitchTargets]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- The branches of a switch are stored in a SwitchTargets, which consists of an
-- (optional) default jump target, and a map from values to jump targets.
--
-- If the default jump target is absent, the behaviour of the switch outside the
-- values of the map is undefined.
--
-- We use an Integer for the keys the map so that it can be used in switches on
-- unsigned as well as signed integers.
--
-- The map may be empty (we prune out-of-range branches here, so it could be us
-- emptying it).
--
-- Before code generation, the table needs to be brought into a form where all
-- entries are non-negative, so that it can be compiled into a jump table.
-- See switchTargetsToTable.


-- | A value of type SwitchTargets contains the alternatives for a 'CmmSwitch'
-- value, and knows whether the value is signed, the possible range, an
-- optional default value and a map from values to jump labels.

-- A SwitchPlan describes how a Switch statement is to be broken down into

--
-- createSwitchPlan creates such a switch plan, in these steps:
--  1. It splits the switch statement at segments of non-default values that
--     are too large. See splitAtHoles and Note [Magic Constants in GHC.Cmm.Switch]
--  2. Too small jump tables should be avoided, so we break up smaller pieces
--     in breakTooSmall.
--  3. We fill in the segments between those pieces with a jump to the default
--     label (if there is one), returning a SeparatedList in mkFlatSwitchPlan
--  4. We find and replace two less-than branches by a single equal-to-test in
--     findSingleValues
--  5. The thus collected pieces are assembled to a balanced binary tree.

  Note [Two alts + default]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discussion and a bit more info at #14644

When dealing with a switch of the form:
switch(e) {
  case 1: goto l1;
  case 3000: goto l2;
  default: goto ldef;
}

If we treat it as a sparse jump table we would generate:

if (e > 3000) //Check if value is outside of the jump table.
    goto ldef;
else {
    if (e < 3000) { //Compare to upper value
        if(e != 1) //Compare to remaining value
            goto ldef;
          else
            goto l2;
    }
    else
        goto l1;
}

Instead we special case this to :

if (e==1) goto l1;
else if (e==3000) goto l2;
else goto l3;

This means we have:
* Less comparisons for: 1,<3000
* Unchanged for 3000
* One more for >3000

This improves code in a few ways:
* One comparison less means smaller code which helps with cache.
* It exchanges a taken jump for two jumps no taken in the >range case.
  Jumps not taken are cheaper (See Agner guides) making this about as fast.
* For all other cases the first range check is removed making it faster.

The end result is that the change is not measurably slower for the case
>3000 and faster for the other cases.

This makes running this kind of match in an inner loop cheaper by 10-20%
depending on the data.
In nofib this improves wheel-sieve1 by 4-9% depending on problem
size.

We could also add a second conditional jump after the comparison to
keep the range check like this:
    cmp 3000, rArgument
    jg <default>
    je <branch 2>
While this is fairly cheap it made no big difference for the >3000 case
and slowed down all other cases making it not worthwhile.

-- Note [GHC.Cmm.Switch vs. GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- I (Joachim) separated the two somewhat closely related modules
--
--  - GHC.Cmm.Switch, which provides the CmmSwitchTargets type and contains the strategy
--    for implementing a Cmm switch (createSwitchPlan), and
--  - GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement, which contains the actual Cmm graph modification,
--
-- for these reasons:
--
--  * GHC.Cmm.Switch is very low in the dependency tree, i.e. does not depend on any
--    GHC specific modules at all (with the exception of Output and
--    GHC.Cmm.Dataflow (Literal)).
--  * GHC.Cmm.Switch.Implement is the Cmm transformation and hence very high in
--    the dependency tree.
--  * GHC.Cmm.Switch provides the CmmSwitchTargets data type, which is abstract, but
--    used in GHC.Cmm.Node.
--  * Because GHC.Cmm.Switch is low in the dependency tree, the separation allows
--    for more parallelism when building GHC.
--  * The interaction between the modules is very explicit and easy to
--    understand, due to the small and simple interface.
