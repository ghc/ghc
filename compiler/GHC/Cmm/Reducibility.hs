Module      : GHC.Cmm.Reducibility
Description : Tell if a `CmmGraph` is reducible, or make it so

Test a Cmm control-flow graph for reducibility.  And provide a
function that, when given an arbitrary control-flow graph, returns an
equivalent, reducible control-flow graph.  The equivalent graph is
obtained by "splitting" (copying) nodes of the original graph.
The resulting equivalent graph has the same dynamic behavior as the
original, but it is larger.

Documentation uses the language of control-flow analysis, in which a
basic block is called a "node."  These "nodes" are `CmmBlock`s or
equivalent; they have nothing to do with a `CmmNode`.
