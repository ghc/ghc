{-
Note [reduceNodesIntoVertices implementations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
reduceNodesIntoVertices is parameterized by the container type.
This is to accommodate key types that don't have an Ord instance
and hence preclude the use of Data.Map. An example of such type
would be Unique, there's no way to implement Ord Unique
deterministically.

For such types, there's a version with a Uniquable constraint.
This leaves us with two versions of every function that depends on
reduceNodesIntoVertices, one with Ord constraint and the other with
Uniquable constraint.
For example: graphFromEdgedVerticesOrd and graphFromEdgedVerticesUniq.

The Uniq version should be a tiny bit more efficient since it uses
Data.IntMap internally.
