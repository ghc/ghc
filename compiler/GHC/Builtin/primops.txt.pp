-- This file is processed by the utility program genprimopcode to produce
-- a number of include files within the compiler and optionally to produce
-- human-readable documentation.
--
-- It should first be preprocessed.
--
-- Note in particular that Haskell block-style comments are not recognized
-- here, so stick to '--' (even for Notes spanning multiple lines).

-- Note [GHC.Prim]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- GHC.Prim is a special module:
--
-- * It can be imported by any module (import GHC.Prim).
--   However, in the future we might change which functions are primitives
--   and which are defined in Haskell.
--   Users should import GHC.Exts, which reexports GHC.Prim and is more stable.
--   In particular, we might move some of the primops to 'foreign import prim'
--   (see ticket #16929 and Note [When do out-of-line primops go in primops.txt.pp])
--
-- * It provides primitives of three sorts:
--   - primitive types such as Int64#, MutableByteArray#
--   - primops such as (+#), newTVar#, touch#
--   - pseudoops such as realWorld#, nullAddr#
--
-- * The pseudoops are described in Note [ghcPrimIds (aka pseudoops)]
--   in GHC.Types.Id.Make.
--
-- * The primitives (primtypes, primops, pseudoops) cannot be defined in
--   source Haskell.
--   There is no GHC/Prim.hs file with definitions.
--   Instead, we support importing GHC.Prim by manually defining its
--   ModIface (see Iface.Load.ghcPrimIface).
--
-- * The primitives are listed in this file, primops.txt.pp.
--   It goes through CPP, which creates primops.txt.
--   It is then consumed by the utility program genprimopcode, which produces
--   the following three types of files.
--
--   1. The files with extension .hs-incl.
--      They can be found by grepping for hs-incl.
--      They are #included in compiler sources.
--
--      One of them, primop-data-decl.hs-incl, defines the PrimOp type:
--        data PrimOp
--         = IntAddOp
--         | IntSubOp
--         | CharGtOp
--         | CharGeOp
--         | ...
--
--      The remaining files define properties of the primops
--      by pattern matching, for example:
--        primOpFixity IntAddOp = Just (Fixity NoSourceText 6 InfixL)
--        primOpFixity IntSubOp = Just (Fixity NoSourceText 6 InfixL)
--        ...
--      This includes fixity, has-side-effects, commutability,
--      IDs used to generate Uniques etc.
--
--      Additionally, we pattern match on PrimOp when generating Cmm in
--      GHC/StgToCmm/Prim.hs.
--
--   2. The dummy Prim.hs file, which is used for Haddock and
--      contains descriptions taken from primops.txt.pp.
--      All definitions are replaced by placeholders.
--      See Note [GHC.Prim Docs] in GHC.Builtin.Utils.
--
--   3. The module PrimopWrappers.hs, which wraps every call for GHCi;
--      see Note [Primop wrappers] in GHC.Builtin.Primops for details.
--
-- * This file does not list internal-only equality types
--   (GHC.Builtin.Types.Prim.unexposedPrimTyCons and coercionToken#
--   in GHC.Types.Id.Make) which are defined but not exported from GHC.Prim.
--   Every export of GHC.Prim should be in listed in this file.
--
-- * The primitive types should be listed in primTyCons in Builtin.Types.Prim
--   in addition to primops.txt.pp.
--   (This task should be delegated to genprimopcode in the future.)
--
--
--
-- Information on how PrimOps are implemented and the steps necessary to
-- add a new one can be found in the Commentary:
--
--  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/commentary/prim-ops
--
-- This file is divided into named sections, each containing or more
-- primop entries. Section headers have the format:
--
--      section "section-name" {haddock-description}
--
-- This information is used solely when producing documentation; it is
-- otherwise ignored.  The haddock-description is optional.
--
-- The format of each primop entry is as follows:
--
--      primop internal-name "name-in-program-text" category type {haddock-description} attributes

-- The default attribute values which apply if you don't specify
-- other ones.  Attribute values can be True, False, or arbitrary
-- text between curly brackets.  This is a kludge to enable
-- processors of this file to easily get hold of simple info
-- (eg, out_of_line), whilst avoiding parsing complex expressions
-- needed for strictness info.
--
-- type refers to the general category of the primop. There are only two:
--
--  * Compare:   A comparison operation of the shape a -> a -> Int#
--  * GenPrimOp: Any other sort of primop
--

-- The vector attribute is rather special. It takes a list of 3-tuples, each of
-- which is of the form <ELEM_TYPE,SCALAR_TYPE,LENGTH>. ELEM_TYPE is the type of
-- the elements in the vector; LENGTH is the length of the vector; and
-- SCALAR_TYPE is the scalar type used to inject to/project from vector
-- element. Note that ELEM_TYPE and SCALAR_TYPE are not the same; for example,
-- to broadcast a scalar value to a vector whose elements are of type Int8, we
-- use an Int#.

-- When a primtype or primop has a vector attribute, it is instantiated at each
-- 3-tuple in the list of 3-tuples. That is, the vector attribute allows us to
-- define a family of types or primops. Vector support also adds three new
-- keywords: VECTOR, SCALAR, and VECTUPLE. These keywords are expanded to types
-- derived from the 3-tuple. For the 3-tuple <Int64#,Int64#,2>, VECTOR expands to
-- Int64X2#, SCALAR expands to Int64#, and VECTUPLE expands to (# Int64#, Int64# #).

-- Note [When do out-of-line primops go in primops.txt.pp]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Out of line primops are those with a C-- implementation. But that
-- doesn't mean they *just* have an C-- implementation. As mentioned in
-- Note [Inlining out-of-line primops and heap checks], some out-of-line
-- primops also have additional internal implementations under certain
-- conditions. Now that `foreign import prim` exists, only those primops
-- which have both internal and external implementations ought to be
-- this file. The rest aren't really primops, since they don't need
-- bespoke compiler support but just a general way to interface with
-- C--. They are just foreign calls.
--
-- Unfortunately, for the time being most of the primops which should be
-- moved according to the previous paragraph can't yet. There are some
-- superficial restrictions in `foreign import prim` which must be fixed
-- first. Specifically, `foreign import prim` always requires:
--
--   - No polymorphism in type
--   - `strictness       = <default>`
--   - `effect           = ReadWriteEffect`
--
-- https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/16929 tracks this issue,
-- and has a table of which external-only primops are blocked by which
-- of these. Hopefully those restrictions are relaxed so the rest of
-- those can be moved over.
--
-- 'module GHC.Prim.Ext is a temporarily "holding ground" for primops
-- that were formally in here, until they can be given a better home.
-- Likewise, their underlying C-- implementation need not live in the
-- RTS either. Best case (in my view), both the C-- and `foreign import
-- prim` can be moved to a small library tailured to the features being
-- implemented and dependencies of those features.

-- Note [Levity and representation polymorphic primops]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- In the types of primops in this module,
--
-- * The names `a,b,c,s` stand for type variables of kind Type
--
-- * The names `a_reppoly` and `b_reppoly` stand for representation-polymorphic
--   type variables. For example:
--      op :: a_reppoly -> b_reppoly -> Int
--   really means
--      op :: forall {rep1 :: RuntimeRep} {rep2 :: RuntimeRep}
--                   (a :: TYPE rep1) (b :: TYPE rep2).
--            a -> b -> Int
--
--   Note:
--     - `a_reppoly` and `b_reppoly` have independent `RuntimeRep`s, which
--       are *inferred* type variables.
--     - any use-site of a primop in which the kind of a type appearing in
--       negative position is `a_reppoly` and `b_reppoly`
--       must instantiate the representation to a concrete RuntimeRep.
--       See Note [Representation-polymorphism checking built-ins] in GHC.Tc.Gen.Head.
--     - `a_reppoly` and `b_reppoly` share textual names with `a` and `b` (respectively).
--       This means one shouldn't write a type involving both `a` and `a_reppoly`.
--
-- * The names `a_levpoly` and `b_levpoly` stand for levity-polymorphic
--   type variables, similar to `a_reppoly` and `b_reppoly`.
--   For example:
--      op :: a_levpoly -> b_levpoly -> Int
--   really means
--      op :: forall {l :: Levity} {k :: Levity}
--                   (a :: TYPE (BoxedRep l)) (b :: TYPE (BoxedRep k)).
--            a -> b -> Int
--  Note:
--     - `a_levpoly` and `b_levpoly` have independent levities `l` and `k` (respectively), and
--       these are inferred (not specified), as seen from the curly brackets.
--     - any use site of a primop in which `a_levpoly` or `b_levpoly` appear as
--       the kind of a type appearing in negative position in the type of the
--       primop, we require the Levity to be instantiated to a concrete Levity.
--     - `a_levpoly` and `b_levpoly` share textual names with `a` and `b` (respectively).
--       This means one shouldn't write a type involving both `a` and `a_levpoly`,
--       nor `a_levpoly` and `a_reppoly`, etc.

section "The word size story."
        {Haskell98 specifies that signed integers (type 'Int')
         must contain at least 30 bits. GHC always implements
         'Int' using the primitive type 'Int#', whose size equals
         the @MachDeps.h@ constant @WORD\_SIZE\_IN\_BITS@.
         This is normally set based on the RTS @ghcautoconf.h@ parameter
         @SIZEOF\_HSWORD@, i.e., 32 bits on 32-bit machines, 64
         bits on 64-bit machines.

         GHC also implements a primitive unsigned integer type
         'Word#' which always has the same number of bits as 'Int#'.

         In addition, GHC supports families of explicit-sized integers
         and words at 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, with the usual
         arithmetic operations, comparisons, and a range of
         conversions.

         Finally, there are strongly deprecated primops for coercing
         between 'Addr#', the primitive type of machine
         addresses, and 'Int#'.  These are pretty bogus anyway,
         but will work on existing 32-bit and 64-bit GHC targets; they
         are completely bogus when tag bits are used in 'Int#',
         so are not available in this case.}

    zero only if you are completely sure that no overflow can occur.
    On a 32-bit platform, the recommended implementation is to do a
    32 x 32 -> 64 signed multiply, and subtract result[63:32] from
    (result[31] >>signed 31).  If this is zero, meaning that the
    upper word is merely a sign extension of the lower one, no
    overflow can occur.

    On a 64-bit platform it is not always possible to
    acquire the top 64 bits of the result.  Therefore, a recommended
    implementation is to take the absolute value of both operands, and
    return 0 iff bits[63:31] of them are zero, since that means that their
    magnitudes fit within 31 bits, so the magnitude of the product must fit
    into 62 bits.

    If in doubt, return non-zero, but do make an effort to create the
    correct answer for small args, since otherwise the performance of
    @(*) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer@ will be poor.

section "Fused multiply-add operations"
  { #fma#

    The fused multiply-add primops 'fmaddFloat#' and 'fmaddDouble#'
    implement the operation

    \[
    \lambda\ x\ y\ z \rightarrow x * y + z
    \]

    with a single floating-point rounding operation at the end, as opposed to
    rounding twice (which can accumulate rounding errors).

    These primops can be compiled directly to a single machine instruction on
    architectures that support them. Currently, these are:

      1. x86 with CPUs that support the FMA3 extended instruction set (which
         includes most processors since 2013).
      2. PowerPC.
      3. AArch64.

    This requires users pass the '-mfma' flag to GHC. Otherwise, the primop
    is implemented by falling back to the C standard library, which might
    perform software emulation (this may yield results that are not IEEE
    compliant on some platforms).

    The additional operations 'fmsubFloat#'/'fmsubDouble#',
    'fnmaddFloat#'/'fnmaddDouble#' and 'fnmsubFloat#'/'fnmsubDouble#' provide
    variants on 'fmaddFloat#'/'fmaddDouble#' in which some signs are changed:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{fmadd}\ x\ y\ z &= \phantom{+} x * y + z \\[8pt]
    \mathrm{fmsub}\ x\ y\ z &= \phantom{+} x * y - z \\[8pt]
    \mathrm{fnmadd}\ x\ y\ z &= - x * y + z \\[8pt]
    \mathrm{fnmsub}\ x\ y\ z &= - x * y - z
    \end{aligned}

section "Small Arrays"

        {Operations on 'SmallArray#'. A 'SmallArray#' works
         just like an 'Array#', but with different space use and
         performance characteristics (that are often useful with small
         arrays). The 'SmallArray#' and 'SmallMutableArray#'
         lack a `card table'. The purpose of a card table is to avoid
         having to scan every element of the array on each GC by
         keeping track of which elements have changed since the last GC
         and only scanning those that have changed. So the consequence
         of there being no card table is that the representation is
         somewhat smaller and the writes are somewhat faster (because
         the card table does not need to be updated). The disadvantage
         of course is that for a 'SmallMutableArray#' the whole
         array has to be scanned on each GC. Thus it is best suited for
         use cases where the mutable array is not long lived, e.g.
         where a mutable array is initialised quickly and then frozen
         to become an immutable 'SmallArray#'.

section "Byte Arrays"
        {A 'ByteArray#' is a region of
         raw memory in the garbage-collected heap, which is not
         scanned for pointers.
         There are three sets of operations for accessing byte array contents:
         index for reading from immutable byte arrays, and read/write
         for mutable byte arrays.  Each set contains operations for a
         range of useful primitive data types.  Each operation takes
         an offset measured in terms of the size of the primitive type
         being read or written.

         }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

primtype ByteArray#
{
  A boxed, unlifted datatype representing a region of raw memory in the garbage-collected heap,
  which is not scanned for pointers during garbage collection.

  It is created by freezing a 'MutableByteArray#' with 'unsafeFreezeByteArray#'.
  Freezing is essentially a no-op, as 'MutableByteArray#' and 'ByteArray#' share the same heap structure under the hood.

  The immutable and mutable variants are commonly used for scenarios requiring high-performance data structures,
  like @Text@, @Primitive Vector@, @Unboxed Array@, and @ShortByteString@.

  Another application of fundamental importance is 'Integer', which is backed by 'ByteArray#'.

  The representation on the heap of a Byte Array is:

  > +------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
  > |            |                 |                       |
  > |   HEADER   | SIZE (in bytes) |       PAYLOAD         |
  > |            |                 |                       |
  > +------------+-----------------+-----------------------+

  To obtain a pointer to actual payload (e.g., for FFI purposes) use 'byteArrayContents#' or 'mutableByteArrayContents#'.

  Alternatively, enabling the @UnliftedFFITypes@ extension
  allows to mention 'ByteArray#' and 'MutableByteArray#' in FFI type signatures directly.
}

primtype MutableByteArray# s
{ A mutable 'ByteAray#'. It can be created in three ways:

  * 'newByteArray#': Create an unpinned array.
  * 'newPinnedByteArray#': This will create a pinned array,
  * 'newAlignedPinnedByteArray#': This will create a pinned array, with a custom alignment.

  Unpinned arrays can be moved around during garbage collection, so you must not store or pass pointers to these values
  if there is a chance for the garbage collector to kick in. That said, even unpinned arrays can be passed to unsafe FFI calls,
  because no garbage collection happens during these unsafe calls
  (see [Guaranteed Call Safety](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/ffi.html#guaranteed-call-safety)
  in the GHC Manual). For safe FFI calls, byte arrays must be not only pinned, but also kept alive by means of the keepAlive# function
  for the duration of a call (that's because garbage collection cannot move a pinned array, but is free to scrap it altogether).

-- This may seem a bit peculiar, because they surely *could*
-- fail spectacularly if passed a pointer to unallocated memory.
-- But MutVar#s are always correct by construction; we never
-- test if a pointer is valid before using it with these operations.
-- So we never have to worry about floating the pointer reference
-- outside a validity test. At the moment, ReadWriteEffect blocks
-- up the relevant optimizations anyway, but we hope to draw finer
-- distinctions soon, which should improve matters for readMutVar#
-- at least.

--
--   MutVar# s a -> (a -> (# a, b #)) -> State# s -> (# State# s, a, (# a, b #) #)
--
-- The reason is that atomicModifyMutVar2# relies on laziness for its atomicity.
-- Given a MutVar# containing x, atomicModifyMutVar2# merely replaces
-- its contents with a thunk of the form (fst (f x)). This can be done using an
-- atomic compare-and-swap as it is merely replacing a pointer.

section "Continuations"
  { #continuations#

    These operations provide access to first-class delimited continuations,
    which allow a computation to access and manipulate portions of its
    /current continuation/. Operationally, they are implemented by direct
    manipulation of the RTS call stack, which may provide significant
    performance gains relative to manual continuation-passing style (CPS) for
    some programs.

    Intuitively, the delimited control operators 'prompt#' and
    'control0#' can be understood by analogy to 'catch#' and 'raiseIO#',
    respectively:

      * Like 'catch#', 'prompt#' does not do anything on its own, it
        just /delimits/ a subcomputation (the source of the name "delimited
        continuations").

      * Like 'raiseIO#', 'control0#' aborts to the nearest enclosing
        'prompt#' before resuming execution.

    However, /unlike/ 'raiseIO#', 'control0#' does /not/ discard
    the aborted computation: instead, it /captures/ it in a form that allows
    it to be resumed later. In other words, 'control0#' does not
    irreversibly abort the local computation before returning to the enclosing
    'prompt#', it merely suspends it. All local context of the suspended
    computation is packaged up and returned as an ordinary function that can be
    invoked at a later point in time to /continue/ execution, which is why
    the suspended computation is known as a /first-class continuation/.

    In GHC, every continuation prompt is associated with exactly one
    'PromptTag#'. Prompt tags are unique, opaque values created by
    'newPromptTag#' that may only be compared for equality. Both 'prompt#'
    and 'control0#' accept a 'PromptTag#' argument, and 'control0#'
    captures the continuation up to the nearest enclosing use of 'prompt#'
    /with the same tag/. This allows a program to control exactly which
    prompt it will abort to by using different tags, similar to how a program
    can control which 'catch' it will abort to by throwing different types
    of exceptions. Additionally, 'PromptTag#' accepts a single type parameter,
    which is used to relate the expected result type at the point of the
    'prompt#' to the type of the continuation produced by 'control0#'.

    == The gory details

    The high-level explanation provided above should hopefully provide some
    intuition for what these operations do, but it is not very precise; this
    section provides a more thorough explanation.

    The 'prompt#' operation morally has the following type:

@
'prompt#' :: 'PromptTag#' a -> IO a -> IO a
@

    If a computation @/m/@ never calls 'control0#', then
    @'prompt#' /tag/ /m/@ is equivalent to just @/m/@, i.e. the 'prompt#' is
    a no-op. This implies the following law:

    \[
    \mathtt{prompt\#}\ \mathit{tag}\ (\mathtt{pure}\ x) \equiv \mathtt{pure}\ x
    \]

    The 'control0#' operation morally has the following type:

@
'control0#' :: 'PromptTag#' a -> ((IO b -> IO a) -> IO a) -> IO b
@

    @'control0#' /tag/ /f/@ captures the current continuation up to the nearest
    enclosing @'prompt#' /tag/@ and resumes execution from the point of the call
    to 'prompt#', passing the captured continuation to @/f/@. To make that
    somewhat more precise, we can say 'control0#' obeys the following law:

    \[
    \mathtt{prompt\#}\ \mathit{tag}\ (\mathtt{control0\#}\ tag\ f \mathbin{\mathtt{>>=}} k)
      \equiv f\ (\lambda\ m \rightarrow m \mathbin{\mathtt{>>=}} k)
    \]

    However, this law does not fully describe the behavior of 'control0#',
    as it does not account for situations where 'control0#' does not appear
    immediately inside 'prompt#'. Capturing the semantics more precisely
    requires some additional notational machinery; a common approach is to
    use [reduction semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics#Reduction_semantics).
    Assuming an appropriate definition of evaluation contexts \(E\), the
    semantics of 'prompt#' and 'control0#' can be given as follows:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    E[\mathtt{prompt\#}\ \mathit{tag}\ (\mathtt{pure}\ v)]
      &\longrightarrow E[\mathtt{pure}\ v] \\[8pt]
    E_1[\mathtt{prompt\#}\ \mathit{tag}\ E_2[\mathtt{control0\#}\ tag\ f]]
      &\longrightarrow E_1[f\ (\lambda\ m \rightarrow E_2[m])] \\[-2pt]
      \mathrm{where}\;\: \mathtt{prompt\#}\ \mathit{tag} &\not\in E_2
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    A full treatment of the semantics and metatheory of delimited control is
    well outside the scope of this documentation, but a good, thorough
    overview (in Haskell) is provided in [A Monadic Framework for Delimited
    Continuations](https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/monadicDC.pdf) by
    Dybvig et al.

    == Safety and invariants

    Correct uses of 'control0#' must obey the following restrictions:

    1. The behavior of 'control0#' is only well-defined within a /strict
       'State#' thread/, such as those associated with @IO@ and strict @ST@
       computations.

    2. Furthermore, 'control0#' may only be called within the dynamic extent
       of a 'prompt#' with a matching tag somewhere in the /current/ strict
       'State#' thread. Effectively, this means that a matching prompt must
       exist somewhere, and the captured continuation must /not/ contain any
       uses of @unsafePerformIO@, @runST@, @unsafeInterleaveIO@, etc. For
       example, the following program is ill-defined:

        @
        'prompt#' /tag/ $
          evaluate (unsafePerformIO $ 'control0#' /tag/ /f/)
        @

        In this example, the use of 'prompt#' appears in a different 'State#'
        thread from the use of 'control0#', so there is no valid prompt in
        scope to capture up to.

    3. Finally, 'control0#' may not be used within 'State#' threads associated
       with an STM transaction (i.e. those introduced by 'atomically#').

    If the runtime is able to detect that any of these invariants have been
    violated in a way that would compromise internal invariants of the runtime,
    'control0#' will fail by raising an exception. However, such violations
    are only detected on a best-effort basis, as the bookkeeping necessary for
    detecting /all/ illegal uses of 'control0#' would have significant overhead.
    Therefore, although the operations are "safe" from the runtime's point of
    view (e.g. they will not compromise memory safety or clobber internal runtime
    state), it is still ultimately the programmer's responsibility to ensure
    these invariants hold to guarantee predictable program behavior.

    In a similar vein, since each captured continuation includes the full local
    context of the suspended computation, it can safely be resumed arbitrarily
    many times without violating any invariants of the runtime system. However,
    use of these operations in an arbitrary 'IO' computation may be unsafe for
    other reasons, as most 'IO' code is not written with reentrancy in mind. For
    example, a computation suspended in the middle of reading a file will likely
    finish reading it when it is resumed; further attempts to resume from the
    same place would then fail because the file handle was already closed.

    In other words, although the RTS ensures that a computation's control state
    and local variables are properly restored for each distinct resumption of
    a continuation, it makes no attempt to duplicate any local state the
    computation may have been using (and could not possibly do so in general).
    Furthermore, it provides no mechanism for an arbitrary computation to
    protect itself against unwanted reentrancy (i.e. there is no analogue to
    Scheme's @dynamic-wind@). For those reasons, manipulating the continuation
    is only safe if the caller can be certain that doing so will not violate any
    expectations or invariants of the enclosing computation. }

-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-- prevent it from being defeated by the optimizer:
--  * Discarding a touch# call would defeat its whole purpose.
--  * Strictly floating a touch# call out would shorten the lifetime
--    of the touched object, again defeating its purpose.
--  * Duplicating a touch# call might unpredictably extend the lifetime
--    of the touched object.  Although this would not defeat the purpose
--    of touch#, it seems undesirable.
--
-- In practice, this designation probably doesn't matter in most cases,
-- as touch# is usually tightly coupled with a "real" read or write effect.

        {Primitives for working with compact regions. The @ghc-compact@
         library and the @compact@ library demonstrate how to use these
         primitives. The documentation below draws a distinction between
         a CNF and a compact block. A CNF contains one or more compact
         blocks. The source file @rts\/sm\/CNF.c@
         diagrams this relationship. When discussing a compact
         block, an additional distinction is drawn between capacity and
         utilized bytes. The capacity is the maximum number of bytes that
         the compact block can hold. The utilized bytes is the number of

   { Returns @1#@ if the given pointers are equal and @0#@ otherwise. }

   effect = CanFail -- See Note [reallyUnsafePtrEquality# CanFail]
   can_fail_warning = DoNotWarnCanFail

-- Note [Pointer comparison operations]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- The primop `reallyUnsafePtrEquality#` does a direct pointer
-- equality between two (boxed) values.  Several things to note:
--
-- (PE1) It is levity-polymorphic. It works for TYPE (BoxedRep Lifted) and
--       TYPE (BoxedRep Unlifted). But not TYPE IntRep, for example.
--       This levity-polymorphism comes from the use of the type variables
--       "a_levpoly" and "b_levpoly". See Note [Levity and representation polymorphic primops]
--
-- (PE2) It is hetero-typed; you can compare pointers of different types.
--       This is used in various packages such as containers & unordered-containers.
--
-- (PE3) It does not evaluate its arguments. The user of the primop is responsible
--       for doing so.  Consider
--            let { x = p+q; y = q+p } in reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x y
--       Here `x` and `y` point to different closures, so the expression will
--       probably return False; but if `x` and/or `y` were evaluated for some
--       other reason, then it might return True.
--
-- (PE4) It is obviously very dangerous, because replacing equals with equals
--       in the program can change the result.  For example
--           let x = f y in reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x x
--       will probably return True, whereas
--            reallyUnsafePtrEquality# (f y) (f y)
--       will probably return False. ("probably", because it's affected
--       by CSE and inlining).
--
-- (PE5) reallyUnsafePtrEquality# can't fail, but it is marked as such
--       to prevent it from floating out.
--       See Note [reallyUnsafePtrEquality# CanFail]
--
-- The library GHC.Prim.PtrEq (and GHC.Exts) provides
--
--   unsafePtrEquality# ::
--     forall (a :: UnliftedType) (b :: UnliftedType). a -> b -> Int#
--
-- It is still heterotyped (like (PE2)), but it's restricted to unlifted types
-- (unlike (PE1)).  That means that (PE3) doesn't apply: unlifted types are
-- always evaluated, which makes it a bit less unsafe.
--
-- However unsafePtrEquality# is /implemented/ by a call to
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality#, so using the former is really just a documentation
-- hint to the reader of the code.  GHC behaves no differently.
--
-- The same library provides less Wild-West functions
-- for use in specific cases, namely:
--
--   reallyUnsafePtrEquality :: a -> a -> Int#  -- not levity-polymorphic, nor hetero-typed
--   sameArray# :: Array# a -> Array# a -> Int#
--   sameMutableArray# :: MutableArray# s a -> MutableArray# s a -> Int#
--   sameSmallArray# :: SmallArray# a -> SmallArray# a -> Int#
--   sameSmallMutableArray# :: SmallMutableArray# s a -> SmallMutableArray# s a -> Int#
--   sameByteArray# :: ByteArray# -> ByteArray# -> Int#
--   sameMutableByteArray# :: MutableByteArray# s -> MutableByteArray# s -> Int#
--   sameArrayArray# :: ArrayArray# -> ArrayArray# -> Int#
--   sameMutableArrayArray# :: MutableArrayArray# s -> MutableArrayArray# s -> Int#
--   sameMutVar# :: MutVar# s a -> MutVar# s a -> Int#
--   sameTVar# :: TVar# s a -> TVar# s a -> Int#
--   sameMVar# :: MVar# s a -> MVar# s a -> Int#
--   sameIOPort# :: IOPort# s a -> IOPort# s a -> Int#
--   eqStableName# :: StableName# a -> StableName# b -> Int#
--
-- These operations are all specialisations of unsafePtrEquality#.

-- Note [reallyUnsafePtrEquality# CanFail]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality# can't actually fail, per se, but we mark it
-- CanFail anyway. Until 5a9a1738023a, GHC considered primops okay for
-- speculation only when their arguments were known to be forced. This was
-- unnecessarily conservative, but it prevented reallyUnsafePtrEquality# from
-- floating out of places where its arguments were known to be forced.
-- Unfortunately, GHC could sometimes lose track of whether those arguments
-- were forced, leading to let-can-float invariant failures (see #13027 and the
-- discussion in #11444). Now that ok_for_speculation skips over lifted
-- arguments, we need to explicitly prevent reallyUnsafePtrEquality#
-- from floating out. Imagine if we had
--
--     \x y . case x of x'
--              DEFAULT ->
--            case y of y'
--              DEFAULT ->
--               let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x' y'
--               in ...
--
-- If the let floats out, we'll get
--
--     \x y . let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x y
--            in case x of ...
--
-- The trouble is that pointer equality between thunks is very different
-- from pointer equality between the values those thunks reduce to, and the latter
-- is typically much more precise.

section "Prefetch"
        {Prefetch operations: Note how every prefetch operation has a name
  with the pattern prefetch*N#, where N is either 0,1,2, or 3.

  This suffix number, N, is the "locality level" of the prefetch, following the
  convention in GCC and other compilers.
  Higher locality numbers correspond to the memory being loaded in more
  levels of the cpu cache, and being retained after initial use. The naming
  convention follows the naming convention of the prefetch intrinsic found
  in the GCC and Clang C compilers.

  On the LLVM backend, prefetch*N# uses the LLVM prefetch intrinsic
  with locality level N. The code generated by LLVM is target architecture
  dependent, but should agree with the GHC NCG on x86 systems.

  On the PPC native backend, prefetch*N is a No-Op.

  On the x86 NCG, N=0 will generate prefetchNTA,
  N=1 generates prefetcht2, N=2 generates prefetcht1, and
  N=3 generates prefetcht0.

  For streaming workloads, the prefetch*0 operations are recommended.
  For workloads which do many reads or writes to a memory location in a short period of time,
  prefetch*3 operations are recommended.

  For further reading about prefetch and associated systems performance optimization,
  the instruction set and optimization manuals by Intel and other CPU vendors are
  excellent starting place.


  The "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual" is
  especially a helpful read, even if your software is meant for other CPU
  architectures or vendor hardware. The manual can be found at
  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.html .

  The @prefetch*@ family of operations has the order of operations
  determined by passing around the 'State#' token.

  To get a "pure" version of these operations, use 'inlinePerformIO' which is quite safe in this context.

  It is important to note that while the prefetch operations will never change the
  answer to a pure computation, They CAN change the memory locations resident
  in a CPU cache and that may change the performance and timing characteristics
  of an application. The prefetch operations are marked as ReadWriteEffect
  to reflect that these operations have side effects with respect to the runtime
  performance characteristics of the resulting code. Additionally, if the prefetchValue
  operations did not have this attribute, GHC does a float out transformation that
  results in a let-can-float invariant violation, at least with the current design.

-- Note [RuntimeRep polymorphism in continuation-style primops]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--  See below.

section "RuntimeRep polymorphism in continuation-style primops"
  {
  Several primops provided by GHC accept continuation arguments with highly polymorphic
  arguments. For instance, consider the type of `catch#`:

    catch# :: forall (r_rep :: RuntimeRep) (r :: TYPE r_rep) w.
              (State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, r #) )
           -> (w -> State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, r #) )
           -> State# RealWorld
           -> (# State# RealWorld, r #)

  This type suggests that we could instantiate `catch#` continuation argument
  (namely, the first argument) with something like,

    f :: State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, (# Int, String, Int8# #) #)

  However, sadly the type does not capture an important limitation of the
  primop. Specifically, due to the operational behavior of `catch#` the result
  type must be representable with a single machine word. In a future GHC
  release we may improve the precision of this type to capture this limitation.

  See #21868.
