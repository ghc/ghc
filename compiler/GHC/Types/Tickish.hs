   Note [Tickish passes]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Tickish annotations store different information depending on
   where they are used. Here's a summary of the differences
   between the passes.

   - CoreTickish: Haskell and Core
         The tickish annotations store the free variables of
         breakpoints.

   - StgTickish: Stg
         The GHCi bytecode generator (GHC.StgToByteCode) needs
         to know the type of each breakpoint in addition to its
         free variables. Since we cannot compute the type from
         an STG expression, the tickish annotations store the
         type of breakpoints in addition to the free variables.

   - CmmTickish: Cmm
         Breakpoints are unsupported and no free variables or
         type are stored.

  -- | A source note.
  --
  -- Source notes are pure annotations: Their presence should neither
  -- influence compilation nor execution. The semantics are given by
  -- causality: The presence of a source note means that a local
  -- change in the referenced source code span will possibly provoke
  -- the generated code to change. On the flip-side, the functionality
  -- of annotated code *must* be invariant against changes to all
  -- source code *except* the spans referenced in the source notes
  -- (see "Causality of optimized Haskell" paper for details).
  --
  -- Therefore extending the scope of any given source note is always
  -- valid. Note that it is still undesirable though, as this reduces
  -- their usefulness for debugging and profiling. Therefore we will
  -- generally try only to make use of this property where it is
  -- necessary to enable optimizations.

-- | A "counting tick" (where tickishCounts is True) is one that

data TickishScoping =
    -- | No scoping: The tick does not care about what code it
    -- covers. Transformations can freely move code inside as well as
    -- outside without any additional annotation obligations

    -- | Soft scoping: We want all code that is covered to stay
    -- covered.  Note that this scope type does not forbid
    -- transformations from happening, as long as all results of
    -- the transformations are still covered by this tick or a copy of
    -- it. For example
    --
    --   let x = tick<...> (let y = foo in bar) in baz
    --     ===>
    --   let x = tick<...> bar; y = tick<...> foo in baz
    --
    -- Is a valid transformation as far as "bar" and "foo" is
    -- concerned, because both still are scoped over by the tick.
    --
    -- Note though that one might object to the "let" not being
    -- covered by the tick any more. However, we are generally lax
    -- with this - constant costs don't matter too much, and given
    -- that the "let" was effectively merged we can view it as having
    -- lost its identity anyway.
    --
    -- Also note that this scoping behaviour allows floating a tick
    -- "upwards" in pretty much any situation. For example:
    --
    --   case foo of x -> tick<...> bar
    --     ==>
    --   tick<...> case foo of x -> bar
    --
    -- While this is always legal, we want to make a best effort to
    -- only make us of this where it exposes transformation
    -- opportunities.
  | SoftScope

    -- | Cost centre scoping: We don't want any costs to move to other
    -- cost-centre stacks. This means we not only want no code or cost
    -- to get moved out of their cost centres, but we also object to
    -- code getting associated with new cost-centre ticks - or
    -- changing the order in which they get applied.
    --
    -- A rule of thumb is that we don't want any code to gain new
    -- annotations. However, there are notable exceptions, for
    -- example:
    --
    --   let f = \y -> foo in tick<...> ... (f x) ...
    --     ==>
    --   tick<...> ... foo[x/y] ...

    -- function does not change the cost-centre stack when the
    -- function is called.
