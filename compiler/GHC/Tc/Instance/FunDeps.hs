Each functional dependency with one variable in the RHS is responsible
for generating a single equality. For instance:
     class C a b | a -> b
The constraints ([Wanted] C Int Bool) and [Wanted] C Int alpha
will generate the following FunDepEqn
     FDEqn { fd_qtvs = []
           , fd_eqs  = [Pair Bool alpha]
           , fd_loc = ... }
However notice that a functional dependency may have more than one variable
in the RHS which will create more than one pair of types in fd_eqs. Example:
     class C a b c | a -> b c
     [Wanted] C Int alpha alpha
     [Wanted] C Int Bool beta
Will generate:
     FDEqn { fd_qtvs = []
           , fd_eqs  = [Pair Bool alpha, Pair alpha beta]
           , fd_loc = ... }

INVARIANT: Corresponding types aren't already equal
That is, there exists at least one non-identity equality in FDEqs.

Note [Improving against instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assume:
   class C a b | a -> b
   instance C Int Bool
   [W] C Int ty

Then `improveFromInstEnv` should return a FDEqn with
   FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [], fd_eqs = [Pair Bool ty] }

describing an equality (Bool ~ ty).  To do this we /match/ the instance head
against the [W], using just the LHS of the fundep; if we match, we return
an equality for the RHS.

Wrinkles:

(1) meta_tvs: sometimes the instance mentions variables in the RHS that
    are not bound in the LHS.  For example

     class C a b | a -> b
     instance C Int (Maybe x)
     [W] C Int ty

    Note that although the `Int` parts match, that does not fix what `x` is.
    So we just make up a fresh unification variable (a meta_tv), to give the
    "shape" of the RHS.  So we emit the FDEqun
       FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [x], fd_eqs = [Pair (Maybe x) ty] }

    Note that the fd_qtvs can be free in the /first/ component of the Pair,
    but not in the second (which comes from the [W] constraint).

(2) Multi-range fundeps. When these meta_tvs are involved, there is a subtle
    difference between the fundep (a -> b c) and the two fundeps (a->b, a->c).
    Consider
       class D a b c | a -> b c
       instance D Int x (Maybe x)
       [W] D Int Bool ty

    Then we'll generate
       FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [x0], fd_eqs = [ x0 ~ Bool, Maybe x0 ~ ty] }
    which generates one fresh unification variable x0

    But if the fundeps had been (a->b, a->c) we'd generate two FDEqns
       FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [x1], fd_eqs = [ x1 ~ Bool ] }
       FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [x2], fd_eqs = [ Maybe x2 ~ ty ] }
    with two FDEqns, generating two separate unification variables.

(3) improveFromInstEnv doesn't return any equations that already hold.
    Reason: then we know if any actual improvement has happened, in
    which case we need to iterate the solver

{-
Given a bunch of predicates that must hold, such as

        C Int t1, C Int t2, C Bool t3, ?x::t4, ?x::t5

improve figures out what extra equations must hold.
For example, if we have

        class C a b | a->b where ...

then improve will return

        [(t1,t2), (t4,t5)]

NOTA BENE:

  * improve does not iterate.  It's possible that when we make
    t1=t2, for example, that will in turn trigger a new equation.
    This would happen if we also had
        C t1 t7, C t2 t8
    If t1=t2, we also get t7=t8.

    improve does *not* do this extra step.  It relies on the caller
    doing so.

  * The equations unify types that are not already equal.  So there
    is no effect iff the result of improve is empty

Note [Coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example
      class C a b | a -> b
      instance theta => C t1 t2

For the coverage condition, we check
   (normal)    fv(t2) `subset` fv(t1)
   (liberal)   fv(t2) `subset` closeWrtFunDeps(fv(t1), theta)

The liberal version  ensures the self-consistency of the instance, but
it does not guarantee termination. Example:

   class Mul a b c | a b -> c where
        (.*.) :: a -> b -> c

   instance Mul Int Int Int where (.*.) = (*)
   instance Mul Int Float Float where x .*. y = fromIntegral x * y
   instance Mul a b c => Mul a [b] [c] where x .*. v = map (x.*.) v

In the third instance, it's not the case that fv([c]) `subset` fv(a,[b]).
But it is the case that fv([c]) `subset` closeWrtFunDeps( theta, fv(a,[b]) )

But it is a mistake to accept the instance because then this defn:
        f = \ b x y -> if b then x .*. [y] else y
makes instance inference go into a loop, because it requires the constraint
        Mul a [b] b

{- Note [Closing over kinds in coverage]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have a fundep  (a::k) -> b
Then if 'a' is instantiated to (x y), where x:k2->*, y:k2,
then fixing x really fixes k2 as well, and so k2 should be added to
the lhs tyvars in the fundep check.

Example (#8391), using liberal coverage
      data Foo a = ...  -- Foo :: forall k. k -> *
      class Bar a b | a -> b
      instance Bar a (Foo a)

    In the instance decl, (a:k) does fix (Foo k a), but only if we notice
    that (a:k) fixes k.  #10109 is another example.

Here is a more subtle example, from HList-0.4.0.0 (#10564)

  class HasFieldM (l :: k) r (v :: Maybe *)
        | l r -> v where ...
  class HasFieldM1 (b :: Maybe [*]) (l :: k) r v
        | b l r -> v where ...
  class HMemberM (e1 :: k) (l :: [k]) (r :: Maybe [k])
        | e1 l -> r

  data Label :: k -> *
  type family LabelsOf (a :: [*]) ::  *

  instance (HMemberM (Label {k} (l::k)) (LabelsOf xs) b,
            HasFieldM1 b l (r xs) v)
         => HasFieldM l (r xs) v where

Is the instance OK? Does {l,r,xs} determine v?  Well:

  * From the instance constraint HMemberM (Label k l) (LabelsOf xs) b,
    plus the fundep "| el l -> r" in class HMameberM,
    we get {l,k,xs} -> b

  * Note the 'k'!! We must call closeOverKinds on the seed set
    ls_tvs = {l,r,xs}, BEFORE doing closeWrtFunDeps, else the {l,k,xs}->b
    fundep won't fire.  This was the reason for #10564.

  * So starting from seeds {l,r,xs,k} we do closeWrtFunDeps to get
    first {l,r,xs,k,b}, via the HMemberM constraint, and then
    {l,r,xs,k,b,v}, via the HasFieldM1 constraint.

  * And that fixes v.

However, we must closeOverKinds whenever augmenting the seed set
in closeWrtFunDeps!  Consider #10109:

  data Succ a   -- Succ :: forall k. k -> *
  class Add (a :: k1) (b :: k2) (ab :: k3) | a b -> ab
  instance (Add a b ab) => Add (Succ {k1} (a :: k1))
                               b
                               (Succ {k3} (ab :: k3})

We start with seed set {a:k1,b:k2} and closeOverKinds to {a,k1,b,k2}.
Now use the fundep to extend to {a,k1,b,k2,ab}.  But we need to
closeOverKinds *again* now to {a,k1,b,k2,ab,k3}, so that we fix all
the variables free in (Succ {k3} ab).

Bottom line:
  * closeOverKinds on initial seeds (done automatically
    by tyCoVarsOfTypes in checkInstCoverage)
  * and closeOverKinds whenever extending those seeds (in closeWrtFunDeps)

Note [The liberal coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(closeWrtFunDeps preds tvs) closes the set of type variables tvs,
wrt functional dependencies in preds.  The result is a superset
of the argument set.  For example, if we have
        class C a b | a->b where ...
then
        closeWrtFunDeps [C (x,y) z, C (x,p) q] {x,y} = {x,y,z}
because if we know x and y then that fixes z.

We also use equality predicates in the predicates; if we have an
assumption `t1 ~ t2`, then we use the fact that if we know `t1` we
also know `t2` and the other way.
  eg    closeWrtFunDeps [C (x,y) z, a ~ x] {a,y} = {a,y,z,x}

closeWrtFunDeps is used
 - when checking the coverage condition for an instance declaration
 - when determining which tyvars are unquantifiable during generalization, in
   GHC.Tc.Solver.decidePromotedTyVars.

Note [Equality superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have
  class (a ~ [b]) => C a b

Remember from Note [The equality types story] in GHC.Builtin.Types.Prim, that
  * (a ~~ b) is a superclass of (a ~ b)
  * (a ~# b) is a superclass of (a ~~ b)

So when closeWrtFunDeps expands superclasses we'll get a (a ~# [b]) superclass.
But that's an EqPred not a ClassPred, and we jolly well do want to
account for the mutual functional dependencies implied by (t1 ~# t2).
Hence the EqPred handling in closeWrtFunDeps.  See #10778.

Note [Care with type functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider (#12803)
  class C x y | x -> y
  type family F a b
  type family G c d = r | r -> d

Now consider
  closeWrtFunDeps (C (F a b) (G c d)) {a,b}

Knowing {a,b} fixes (F a b) regardless of the injectivity of F.
But knowing (G c d) fixes only {d}, because G is only injective
in its second parameter.

Hence the tyCoVarsOfTypes/injTyVarsOfTypes dance in tv_fds.

Implicit params don't really determine a type variable (that is, we might have
IP "c" Bool and IP "c" Int in different places within the same program), and
skipping this causes implicit params to monomorphise too many variables; see

Here is the bad case:
        class C a b | a->b where ...
        instance C Int Bool where ...
        instance C Int Char where ...

The point is that a->b, so Int in the first parameter must uniquely
determine the second.  In general, given the same class decl, and given

        instance C s1 s2 where ...
        instance C t1 t2 where ...

Then the criterion is: if U=unify(s1,t1) then U(s2) = U(t2).

Matters are a little more complicated if there are free variables in
the s2/t2.

        class D a b c | a -> b
        instance D a b => D [(a,a)] [b] Int
        instance D a b => D [a]     [b] Bool

The instance decls don't overlap, because the third parameter keeps
them separate.  But we want to make sure that given any constraint
        D s1 s2 s3
if s1 matches

Note [Bogus consistency check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In checkFunDeps we check that a new ClsInst is consistent with all the
ClsInsts in the environment.

The bogus aspect is discussed in #10675. Currently it if the two
types are *contradictory*, using (isNothing . tcUnifyTys).  But all
the papers say we should check if the two types are *equal* thus
   not (substTys subst rtys1 `eqTypes` substTys subst rtys2)
For now I'm leaving the bogus form because that's the way it has
been for years.
