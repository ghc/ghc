Typechecking instance declarations is done in two passes. The first
pass, made by @tcInstDecls1@, collects information to be used in the
second pass.

This pre-processed info includes the as-yet-unprocessed bindings
inside the instance declaration.  These are type-checked in the second
pass, when the class-instance envs and GVE contain all the info from
all the instance and value decls.  Indeed that's the reason we need
two passes over the instance decls.


Note [How instance declarations are translated]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is how we translate instance declarations into Core

Running example:
        class C a where
           op1, op2 :: Ix b => a -> b -> b
           op2 = <dm-rhs>

        instance C a => C [a]
           {-# INLINE [2] op1 #-}
           op1 = <rhs>
===>
        -- Method selectors
        op1,op2 :: forall a. C a => forall b. Ix b => a -> b -> b
        op1 = ...
        op2 = ...

        -- Default methods get the 'self' dictionary as argument
        -- so they can call other methods at the same type
        -- Default methods get the same type as their method selector
        $dmop2 :: forall a. C a => forall b. Ix b => a -> b -> b
        $dmop2 = /\a. \(d:C a). /\b. \(d2: Ix b). <dm-rhs>
               -- NB: type variables 'a' and 'b' are *both* in scope in <dm-rhs>
               -- Note [Tricky type variable scoping]

        -- A top-level definition for each instance method
        -- Here op1_i, op2_i are the "instance method Ids"
        -- The INLINE pragma comes from the user pragma
        {-# INLINE [2] op1_i #-}  -- From the instance decl bindings
        op1_i, op2_i :: forall a. C a => forall b. Ix b => [a] -> b -> b
        op1_i = /\a. \(d:C a).
               let this :: C [a]
                   this = df_i a d
                     -- Note [Subtle interaction of recursion and overlap]

                   local_op1 :: forall b. Ix b => [a] -> b -> b
                   local_op1 = <rhs>
                     -- Source code; run the type checker on this
                     -- NB: Type variable 'a' (but not 'b') is in scope in <rhs>
                     -- Note [Tricky type variable scoping]

               in local_op1 a d

        op2_i = /\a \d:C a. $dmop2 [a] (df_i a d)

        -- The dictionary function itself
        {-# NOINLINE CONLIKE df_i #-}   -- Never inline dictionary functions
        df_i :: forall a. C a -> C [a]
        df_i = /\a. \d:C a. MkC (op1_i a d) (op2_i a d)
                -- But see Note [Default methods in instances]
                -- We can't apply the type checker to the default-method call

        -- Use a RULE to short-circuit applications of the class ops
        {-# RULE "op1@C[a]" forall a, d:C a.
                            op1 [a] (df_i d) = op1_i a d #-}

Note [Instances and loop breakers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Note that df_i may be mutually recursive with both op1_i and op2_i.
  It's crucial that df_i is not chosen as the loop breaker, even
  though op1_i has a (user-specified) INLINE pragma.

* Instead the idea is to inline df_i into op1_i, which may then select
  methods from the MkC record, and thereby break the recursion with
  df_i, leaving a *self*-recursive op1_i.  (If op1_i doesn't call op at
  the same type, it won't mention df_i, so there won't be recursion in
  the first place.)

* If op1_i is marked INLINE by the user there's a danger that we won't
  inline df_i in it, and that in turn means that (since it'll be a
  loop-breaker because df_i isn't), op1_i will ironically never be
  inlined.  But this is OK: the recursion breaking happens by way of
  a RULE (the magic ClassOp rule above), and RULES work inside stable
  unfoldings. See Note [RULEs enabled in InitialPhase] in GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Utils

Note [ClassOp/DFun selection]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One thing we see a lot is stuff like
    op2 (df d1 d2)
where 'op2' is a ClassOp and 'df' is DFun.  Now, we could inline *both*
'op2' and 'df' to get
     case (MkD ($cop1 d1 d2) ($cop2 d1 d2) ... of
       MkD _ op2 _ _ _ -> op2
And that will reduce to ($cop2 d1 d2) which is what we wanted.

But it's tricky to make this work in practice, because it requires us to
inline both 'op2' and 'df'.  But neither is keen to inline without having
seen the other's result; and it's very easy to get code bloat (from the
big intermediate) if you inline a bit too much.

Instead we use a cunning trick.
 * We arrange that 'df' and 'op2' NEVER inline.

 * We arrange that 'df' is ALWAYS defined in the sylised form
      df d1 d2 = MkD ($cop1 d1 d2) ($cop2 d1 d2) ...

 * We give 'df' a magical unfolding (DFunUnfolding [$cop1, $cop2, ..])
   that lists its methods.

 * We make GHC.Core.Unfold.exprIsConApp_maybe spot a DFunUnfolding and return
   a suitable constructor application -- inlining df "on the fly" as it
   were.

 * ClassOp rules: We give the ClassOp 'op2' a BuiltinRule that
   extracts the right piece iff its argument satisfies
   exprIsConApp_maybe.  This is done in GHC.Types.Id.Make.mkDictSelId

 * We make 'df' CONLIKE, so that shared uses still match; eg
      let d = df d1 d2
      in ...(op2 d)...(op1 d)...

Note [Single-method classes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the class has just one method (or, more accurately, just one element
of {superclasses + methods}), then we use a different strategy.

   class C a where op :: a -> a
   instance C a => C [a] where op = <blah>

We translate the class decl into a newtype, which just gives a
top-level axiom. The "constructor" MkC expands to a cast, as does the
class-op selector.

   axiom Co:C a :: C a ~ (a->a)

   op :: forall a. C a -> (a -> a)
   op a d = d |> (Co:C a)

   MkC :: forall a. (a->a) -> C a
   MkC = /\a.\op. op |> (sym Co:C a)

The clever RULE stuff doesn't work now, because ($df a d) isn't
a constructor application, so exprIsConApp_maybe won't return
Just <blah>.

Instead, we simply rely on the fact that casts are cheap:

   $df :: forall a. C a => C [a]
   {-# INLINE df #-}  -- NB: INLINE this
   $df = /\a. \d. MkC [a] ($cop_list a d)
       = $cop_list |> forall a. C a -> (sym (Co:C [a]))

   $cop_list :: forall a. C a => [a] -> [a]
   $cop_list = <blah>

So if we see
   (op ($df a d))
we'll inline 'op' and '$df', since both are simply casts, and
good things happen.

Why do we use this different strategy?  Because otherwise we
end up with non-inlined dictionaries that look like
    $df = $cop |> blah
which adds an extra indirection to every use, which seems stupid.  See
#4138 for an example (although the regression reported there
wasn't due to the indirection).

There is an awkward wrinkle though: we want to be very
careful when we have
    instance C a => C [a] where
      {-# INLINE op #-}
      op = ...
then we'll get an INLINE pragma on $cop_list but it's important that
$cop_list only inlines when it's applied to *two* arguments (the
dictionary and the list argument).  So we must not eta-expand $df
above.  We ensure that this doesn't happen by putting an INLINE
pragma on the dfun itself; after all, it ends up being just a cast.

There is one more dark corner to the INLINE story, even more deeply
buried.  Consider this (#3772):

    class DeepSeq a => C a where
      gen :: Int -> a

    instance C a => C [a] where
      gen n = ...

    class DeepSeq a where
      deepSeq :: a -> b -> b

    instance DeepSeq a => DeepSeq [a] where
      {-# INLINE deepSeq #-}
      deepSeq xs b = foldr deepSeq b xs

That gives rise to these defns:

    $cdeepSeq :: DeepSeq a -> [a] -> b -> b
    -- User INLINE( 3 args )!
    $cdeepSeq a (d:DS a) b (x:[a]) (y:b) = ...

    $fDeepSeq[] :: DeepSeq a -> DeepSeq [a]
    -- DFun (with auto INLINE pragma)
    $fDeepSeq[] a d = $cdeepSeq a d |> blah

    $cp1 a d :: C a => DeepSep [a]
    -- We don't want to eta-expand this, lest
    -- $cdeepSeq gets inlined in it!
    $cp1 a d = $fDeepSep[] a (scsel a d)

    $fC[] :: C a => C [a]
    -- Ordinary DFun
    $fC[] a d = MkC ($cp1 a d) ($cgen a d)

Here $cp1 is the code that generates the superclass for C [a].  The
issue is this: we must not eta-expand $cp1 either, or else $fDeepSeq[]
and then $cdeepSeq will inline there, which is definitely wrong.  Like
on the dfun, we solve this by adding an INLINE pragma to $cp1.

Note [Subtle interaction of recursion and overlap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this
  class C a where { op1,op2 :: a -> a }
  instance C a => C [a] where
    op1 x = op2 x ++ op2 x
    op2 x = ...
  instance C [Int] where
    ...

When type-checking the C [a] instance, we need a C [a] dictionary (for
the call of op2).  If we look up in the instance environment, we find
an overlap.  And in *general* the right thing is to complain (see Note
[Overlapping instances] in GHC.Core.InstEnv).  But in *this* case it's wrong to
complain, because we just want to delegate to the op2 of this same
instance.

Why is this justified?  Because we generate a (C [a]) constraint in
a context in which 'a' cannot be instantiated to anything that matches
other overlapping instances, or else we would not be executing this
version of op1 in the first place.

It might even be a bit disguised:

  nullFail :: C [a] => [a] -> [a]
  nullFail x = op2 x ++ op2 x

  instance C a => C [a] where
    op1 x = nullFail x

Precisely this is used in package 'regex-base', module Context.hs.
See the overlapping instances for RegexContext, and the fact that they
call 'nullFail' just like the example above.  The DoCon package also
does the same thing; it shows up in module Fraction.hs.

Conclusion: when typechecking the methods in a C [a] instance, we want to
treat the 'a' as an *existential* type variable, in the sense described
by Note [Binding when looking up instances].  That is why isOverlappableTyVar
responds True to an InstSkol, which is the kind of skolem we use in
tcInstDecl2.


Note [Tricky type variable scoping]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In our example
        class C a where
           op1, op2 :: Ix b => a -> b -> b
           op2 = <dm-rhs>

        instance C a => C [a]
           {-# INLINE [2] op1 #-}
           op1 = <rhs>

note that 'a' and 'b' are *both* in scope in <dm-rhs>, but only 'a' is
in scope in <rhs>.  In particular, we must make sure that 'b' is in
scope when typechecking <dm-rhs>.  This is achieved by subFunTys,
which brings appropriate tyvars into scope. This happens for both
<dm-rhs> and for <rhs>, but that doesn't matter: the *renamer* will have
complained if 'b' is mentioned in <rhs>.

Note [Deriving inside TH brackets]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given a declaration bracket
  [d| data T = A | B deriving( Show ) |]

there is really no point in generating the derived code for deriving(
Show) and then type-checking it. This will happen at the call site
anyway, and the type check should never fail!  Moreover (#6005)
the scoping of the generated code inside the bracket does not seem to
work out.

The easy solution is simply not to generate the derived instances at
all.  (A less brutal solution would be to generate them with no
bindings.)  This will become moot when we shift to the new TH plan, so
the brutal solution will do.

Family instances are somewhat of a hybrid.  They are processed together with
class instance heads, but can contain data constructors and hence they share a
lot of kinding and type checking code with ordinary algebraic data types (and
GADTs).

We allow this:
  class C a where
    type T x a
  instance C Int where
    type T (S y) Int = y
    type T Z     Int = Char

Note that
  a) The variable 'x' is not bound by the class decl
  b) 'x' is instantiated to a non-type-variable in the instance
  c) There are several type instance decls for T in the instance

All this is fine.  Of course, you can't give any *more* instances
for (T ty Int) elsewhere, because it's an *associated* type.

Note [Associated data family instances and di_scoped_tvs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some care is required to implement `deriving` correctly for associated data
family instances. Consider this example from #18055:

  class C a where
    data D a

  class X a b

  instance C (Maybe a) where
    data D (Maybe a) deriving (X a)

When typechecking the `X a` in `deriving (X a)`, we must ensure that the `a`
from the instance header is brought into scope. This is the role of
di_scoped_tvs, which maps from the original, renamed `a` to the skolemized,
typechecked `a`. When typechecking the `deriving` clause, this mapping will be
consulted when looking up the `a` in `X a`.

A naïve attempt at creating the di_scoped_tvs is to simply reuse the
tyConTyVars of the representation TyCon for `data D (Maybe a)`. This is only
half correct, however. We do want the typechecked `a`'s Name in the /range/
of the mapping, but we do not want it in the /domain/ of the mapping.
To ensure that the original `a`'s Name ends up in the domain, we consult a
TyVarEnv (passed as an argument to tcDataFamInstDecl) that maps from the
typechecked `a`'s Name to the original `a`'s Name. In the even that
tcDataFamInstDecl is processing a non-associated data family instance, this
TyVarEnv will simply be empty, and there is nothing to worry about.

{- Note [Result kind signature for a data family instance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The expected type might have a forall at the type. Normally, we
can't skolemise in kinds because we don't have type-level lambda.
But here, we're at the top-level of an instance declaration, so
we actually have a place to put the regeneralised variables.
Thus: skolemise away. cf. GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.tcTopSkolemise
Examples in indexed-types/should_compile/T12369

Note [Implementing eta reduction for data families]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   data D :: * -> * -> * -> * -> *

   data instance D [(a,b)] p q :: * -> * where
      D1 :: blah1
      D2 :: blah2

Then we'll generate a representation data type
  data Drep a b p q z where
      D1 :: blah1
      D2 :: blah2

and an axiom to connect them
  axiom AxDrep forall a b p q z. D [(a,b]] p q z = Drep a b p q z

except that we'll eta-reduce the axiom to
  axiom AxDrep forall a b. D [(a,b]] = Drep a b

This is described at some length in Note [Eta reduction for data families]
in GHC.Core.Coercion.Axiom. There are several fiddly subtleties lurking here,
however, so this Note aims to describe these subtleties:

* The representation tycon Drep is parameterised over the free
  variables of the pattern, in no particular order. So there is no
  guarantee that 'p' and 'q' will come last in Drep's parameters, and
  in the right order.  So, if the /patterns/ of the family instance
  are eta-reducible, we re-order Drep's parameters to put the
  eta-reduced type variables last.

* Although we eta-reduce the axiom, we eta-/expand/ the representation
  tycon Drep.  The kind of D says it takes four arguments, but the
  data instance header only supplies three.  But the AlgTyCon for Drep
  itself must have enough TyConBinders so that its result kind is Type.
  So, with etaExpandAlgTyCon we make up some extra TyConBinders.
  See point (3) in Note [Datatype return kinds] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.

* The result kind in the instance might be a polykind, like this:
     data family DP a :: forall k. k -> *
     data instance DP [b] :: forall k1 k2. (k1,k2) -> *

  So in type-checking the LHS (DP Int) we need to check that it is
  more polymorphic than the signature.  To do that we must skolemise
  the signature and instantiate the call of DP.  So we end up with
     data instance DP [b] @(k1,k2) (z :: (k1,k2)) where

  Note that we must parameterise the representation tycon DPrep over
  'k1' and 'k2', as well as 'b'.

  The skolemise bit is done in tc_kind_sig, while the instantiate bit
  is done by tcFamTyPats.

* Very fiddly point.  When we eta-reduce to
     axiom AxDrep forall a b. D [(a,b]] = Drep a b

  we want the kind of (D [(a,b)]) to be the same as the kind of
  (Drep a b).  This ensures that applying the axiom doesn't change the
  kind.  Why is that hard?  Because the kind of (Drep a b) depends on
  the TyConBndrVis on Drep's arguments. In particular do we have
    (forall (k::*). blah) or (* -> blah)?

  We must match whatever D does!  In #15817 we had
      data family X a :: forall k. * -> *   -- Note: a forall that is not used
      data instance X Int b = MkX

  So the data instance is really
      data istance X Int @k b = MkX

  The axiom will look like
      axiom    X Int = Xrep

  and it's important that XRep :: forall k * -> *, following X.

  To achieve this we get the TyConBndrVis flags from tcbVisibilities,
  and use those flags for any eta-reduced arguments.  Sigh.

* The final turn of the knife is that tcbVisibilities is itself
  tricky to sort out.  Consider
      data family D k :: k
  Then consider D (forall k2. k2 -> k2) Type Type
  The visibility flags on an application of D may affected by the arguments
  themselves.  Heavy sigh.  But not truly hard; that's what tcbVisibilities
  does.

* Happily, we don't need to worry about the possibility of
  building an inhomogeneous axiom, described in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Build
  Note [Newtype eta and homogeneous axioms].   For example
     type F :: Type -> forall (b :: Type) -> Type
     data family F a b
     newtype instance F Int b = MkF (Proxy b)
  we get a newtype, and a eta-reduced axiom connecting the data family
  with the newtype:
     type R:FIntb :: forall (b :: Type) -> Type
     newtype R:FIntb b = MkF (Proxy b)
     axiom Foo.D:R:FIntb0 :: F Int = Foo.R:FIntb
  Now the subtleties of Note [Newtype eta and homogeneous axioms] are
  dealt with by the newtype (via mkNewTyConRhs called in tcDataFamInstDecl)
  while the axiom connecting F Int ~ R:FIntb is eta-reduced, but the
  quantifier 'b' is derived from the original data family F, and so the
  kinds will always match.

Note [Kind inference for data family instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this GADT-style data type declaration, where I have used
fresh variables in the data constructor's type, to stress that c,d are
quite distinct from a,b.
   data T a b where
     MkT :: forall c d. c d -> T c d

Following Note [Inferring kinds for type declarations] in GHC.Tc.TyCl,
to infer T's kind, we initially give T :: kappa, a monomorpic kind,
gather constraints from the header and data constructors, and conclude
   T :: (kappa1 -> type) -> kappa1 -> Type
Then we generalise, giving
   T :: forall k. (k->Type) -> k -> Type

Now what about a data /instance/ decl
   data family T :: forall k. (k->Type) -> k -> Type

   data instance T p Int where ...

No doubt here! The poly-kinded T is instantiated with k=Type, so the
header really looks like
   data instance T @Type (p :: Type->Type) Int where ...

But what about this?
   data instance T p q where
      MkT :: forall r. r Int -> T r Int

So what kind do 'p' and 'q' have?  No clues from the header, but from
the data constructor we can clearly see that (r :: Type->Type).  Does
that mean that the /entire data instance/ is instantiated at Type,
like this?
   data instance T @Type (p :: Type->Type) (q :: Type) where
      ...

Not at all! This is a /GADT/-style decl, so the kind argument might
be specialised in this particular data constructor, thus:
   data instance T @k (p :: k->Type) (q :: k) where
     MkT :: forall (r :: Type -> Type).
            r Int -> T @Type r Int
(and perhaps specialised differently in some other data
constructor MkT2).

The key difference in this case and 'data T' at the top of this Note
is that we have no known kind for 'data T'. We thus forbid different
specialisations of T in its constructors, in an attempt to avoid
inferring polymorphic recursion. In data family T, however, there is
no problem with polymorphic recursion: we already /fully know/ T's
kind -- that came from the family declaration, and is not influenced
by the data instances -- and hence we /can/ specialise T's kind
differently in different GADT data constructors.

SHORT SUMMARY: in a data instance decl, it's not clear whether kind
constraints arising from the data constructors should be considered
local to the (GADT) data /constructor/ or should apply to the entire
data instance.

DESIGN CHOICE: in data/newtype family instance declarations, we ignore
the /data constructor/ declarations altogether, looking only at the
data instance /header/.

Observations:
* This choice is simple to describe, as well as simple to implement.
  For a data/newtype instance decl, the instance kinds are influenced
  /only/ by the header.

* We could treat Haskell-98 style data-instance decls differently, by
  taking the data constructors into account, since there are no GADT
  issues.  But we don't, for simplicity, and because it means you can
  understand the data type instance by looking only at the header.

* Newtypes can be declared in GADT syntax, but they can't do GADT-style
  specialisation, so like Haskell-98 definitions we could take the
  data constructors into account.  Again we don't, for the same reason.

So for now at least, we keep the simplest choice. See #18891 and !4419
for more discussion of this issue.

Kind inference for data types (Xie et al) https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06153
takes a slightly different approach.

{- Note [Default methods in the type environment]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default method Ids are already in the type environment (see Note
[Default method Ids and Template Haskell] in TcTyDcls), BUT they
don't have their InlinePragmas yet.  Usually that would not matter,
because the simplifier propagates information from binding site to
use.  But, unusually, when compiling instance decls we *copy* the
INLINE pragma from the default method to the method for that
particular operation (see Note [INLINE and default methods] below).

So right here in tcInstDecls2 we must re-extend the type envt with
the default method Ids replete with their INLINE pragmas.  Urk.

{- Note [Typechecking plan for instance declarations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For instance declarations we generate the following bindings and implication
constraints.  Example:

   instance Ord a => Ord [a] where compare = <compare-rhs>

generates this:

   Bindings:
      -- Method bindings
      $ccompare :: forall a. Ord a => a -> a -> Ordering
      $ccompare = /\a \(d:Ord a). let <meth-ev-binds> in ...

      -- Superclass bindings
      $cp1Ord :: forall a. Ord a => Eq [a]
      $cp1Ord = /\a \(d:Ord a). let <sc-ev-binds>
               in dfEqList (dw :: Eq a)

   Constraints:
      forall a. Ord a =>
                -- Method constraint
             (forall. (empty) => <constraints from compare-rhs>)
                -- Superclass constraint
          /\ (forall. (empty) => dw :: Eq a)

Notice that

 * Per-meth/sc implication.  There is one inner implication per
   superclass or method, with no skolem variables or givens.  The only
   reason for this one is to gather the evidence bindings privately
   for this superclass or method.  This implication is generated
   by checkInstConstraints.

 * Overall instance implication. There is an overall enclosing
   implication for the whole instance declaration, with the expected
   skolems and givens.  We need this to get the correct "redundant
   constraint" warnings, gathering all the uses from all the methods
   and superclasses.  See GHC.Tc.Solver Note [Tracking redundant
   constraints]

 * The given constraints in the outer implication may generate
   evidence, notably by superclass selection.  Since the method and
   superclass bindings are top-level, we want that evidence copied
   into *every* method or superclass definition.  (Some of it will
   be usused in some, but dead-code elimination will drop it.)

   We achieve this by putting the evidence variable for the overall
   instance implication into the AbsBinds for each method/superclass.
   Hence the 'dfun_ev_binds' passed into tcMethods and tcSuperClasses.
   (And that in turn is why the abs_ev_binds field of AbBinds is a
   [TcEvBinds] rather than simply TcEvBinds.

   This is a bit of a hack, but works very nicely in practice.

 * Note that if a method has a locally-polymorphic binding, there will
   be yet another implication for that, generated by tcPolyCheck
   in tcMethodBody. E.g.
          class C a where
            foo :: forall b. Ord b => blah

Note [Recursive superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See #3731, #4809, #5751, #5913, #6117, #6161, which all
describe somewhat more complicated situations, but ones
encountered in practice.

See also tests tcrun020, tcrun021, tcrun033, and #11427.

----- THE PROBLEM --------
The problem is that it is all too easy to create a class whose
superclass is bottom when it should not be.

Consider the following (extreme) situation:
        class C a => D a where ...
        instance D [a] => D [a] where ...   (dfunD)
        instance C [a] => C [a] where ...   (dfunC)
Although this looks wrong (assume D [a] to prove D [a]), it is only a
more extreme case of what happens with recursive dictionaries, and it
can, just about, make sense because the methods do some work before
recursing.

To implement the dfunD we must generate code for the superclass C [a],
which we had better not get by superclass selection from the supplied
argument:
       dfunD :: forall a. D [a] -> D [a]
       dfunD = \d::D [a] -> MkD (scsel d) ..

Otherwise if we later encounter a situation where
we have a [Wanted] dw::D [a] we might solve it thus:
     dw := dfunD dw
Which is all fine except that now ** the superclass C is bottom **!

The instance we want is:
       dfunD :: forall a. D [a] -> D [a]
       dfunD = \d::D [a] -> MkD (dfunC (scsel d)) ...

----- THE SOLUTION --------
The basic solution is simple: be very careful about using superclass
selection to generate a superclass witness in a dictionary function
definition.  More precisely:

  Superclass Invariant: in every class dictionary,
                        every superclass dictionary field
                        is non-bottom

To achieve the Superclass Invariant, in a dfun definition we can
generate a guaranteed-non-bottom superclass witness from:
  (sc1) one of the dictionary arguments itself (all non-bottom)
  (sc2) an immediate superclass of a non-bottom dictionary that is
        /Paterson-smaller/ than the instance head
        See Note [The PatersonSize of a type] in GHC.Tc.Utils.TcType
  (sc3) a call of a dfun (always returns a dictionary constructor)

The tricky case is (sc2).  We proceed by induction on the size of the
(type of) the dictionary, defined by GHC.Tc.Utils.TcType.pSizeType.  Let's
suppose we are building a dictionary of size 3 (the "head"), and suppose
the Superclass Invariant holds of smaller dictionaries.  Then if we have a
smaller dictionary, its immediate superclasses will be non-bottom by
induction.

Why "Paterson-smaller"? See Note [Paterson conditions] in GHC.Tc.Validity.
We want to be sure that the superclass dictionary is smaller /for any
ground instatiation/ of the instance, so we need to account for type
variables that occur more than once, and for type families (#20666).  And
that's exactly what the Paterson conditions check!

Here is an example, taken from CmmExpr:
       class Ord r => UserOfRegs r a where ...
(i1)   instance UserOfRegs r a => UserOfRegs r (Maybe a) where
(i2)   instance (Ord r, UserOfRegs r CmmReg) => UserOfRegs r CmmExpr where

For (i1) we can get the (Ord r) superclass by selection from
(UserOfRegs r a), since it (i.e. UserOfRegs r a) is smaller than the
thing we are building, namely (UserOfRegs r (Maybe a)).

But for (i2) that isn't the case: (UserOfRegs r CmmReg) is not smaller
than the thing we are building (UserOfRegs r CmmExpr), so we can't use
the superclasses of the former.  Hence we must instead add an explicit,
and perhaps surprising, (Ord r) argument to the instance declaration.

Here's another example from #6161:

       class         Super a => Duper a  where ...
       class Duper (Maybe a) => Foo a    where ...
(i3)   instance Foo a => Duper (Maybe a) where ...
(i4)   instance                Foo Float where ...

It would be horribly wrong to define
   dfDuperMaybe :: Foo a -> Duper (Maybe a)  -- from (i3)
   dfDuperMaybe d = MkDuper (sc_sel1 (sc_sel2 d)) ...

   dfFooFloat :: Foo Float               -- from (i4)
   dfFooFloat = MkFoo (dfDuperMaybe dfFooFloat) ...

Let's expand the RHS of dfFooFloat:
   dfFooFloat = MkFoo (MkDuper (sc_sel1 (sc_sel2 dfFooFloat)) ...) ...
That superclass argument to MkDuper is bottom!

This program gets rejected because:
* When processing (i3) we need to construct a dictionary for Super
  (Maybe a), to put in the superclass field of (Duper (Maybe a)).
* We /can/ use the superclasses of (Foo a), because the latter is
  smaller than the head of the instance, namely Duper (Maybe a).
* So we know (by (sc2)) that this Duper (Maybe a) dictionary is
  non-bottom.  But because (Duper (Maybe a)) is not smaller than the
  instance head (Duper (Maybe a)), we can't take *its* superclasses.
As a result the program is rightly rejected, unless you add
(Super (Maybe a)) to the context of (i3).

Wrinkle (W1):
    (sc2) says we only get a non-bottom dict if the dict we are
    selecting from is itself non-bottom.  So in a superclass chain,
    all the dictionaries in the chain must be non-bottom.
        class C a => D3 a
        class D2 a [[Maybe b]] => D1 a b
        class D3 a             => D2 a b
        class C a => E a b
        instance D1 a b => E a [b]
    The instance needs the wanted superclass (C a).  We can get it
    by superclass selection from
       D1 a b --> D2 a [[Maybe b]] --> D3 a --> C a
    But on the way we go through the too-big (D2 a [[Maybe b]]), and
    we don't know that is non-bottom.

Note [Solving superclass constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do we ensure that every superclass witness in an instance declaration
is generated by one of (sc1) (sc2) or (sc3) in Note [Recursive superclasses]?
Answer:

  * The "given" constraints of an instance decl have CtOrigin of
    (GivenOrigin (InstSkol head_size)), where head_size is the
    PatersonSize of the head of the instance declaration.  E.g. in
        instance D a => C [a]
    the `[G] D a` constraint has a CtOrigin whose head_size is the
    PatersonSize of (C [a]).

  * When we make a superclass selection from a Given (transitively)
    we give it a CtOrigin of (GivenSCOrigin skol_info sc_depth blocked).

    The 'blocked :: Bool' flag says if the superclass can be used to
    solve a superclass Wanted. The new superclass is blocked unless:

       it is the superclass of an unblocked dictionary (wrinkle (W1)),
       that is Paterson-smaller than the instance head.

    This is implemented in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.mk_strict_superclasses
    (in the mk_given_loc helper function).

  * Superclass "Wanted" constraints have CtOrigin of (ScOrigin NakedSc)
    The 'NakedSc' says that this is a naked superclass Wanted; we must
    be careful when solving it.

  * (sc1) When we rewrite such a wanted constraint, it retains its
    origin.  But if we apply an instance declaration, we can set the
    origin to (ScOrigin NotNakedSc), thus lifting any restrictions by
    making prohibitedSuperClassSolve return False. This happens
    in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.checkInstanceOK.

  * (sc2) ScOrigin wanted constraints can't be solved from a
    superclass selection, except at a smaller type.  This test is
    implemented by GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.prohibitedSuperClassSolve

Note [Silent superclass arguments] (historical interest only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NB1: this note describes our *old* solution to the
     recursive-superclass problem. I'm keeping the Note
     for now, just as institutional memory.
     However, the code for silent superclass arguments
     was removed in late Dec 2014

NB2: the silent-superclass solution introduced new problems
     of its own, in the form of instance overlap.  Tests
     SilentParametersOverlapping, T5051, and T7862 are examples

NB3: the silent-superclass solution also generated tons of
     extra dictionaries.  For example, in monad-transformer
     code, when constructing a Monad dictionary you had to pass
     an Applicative dictionary; and to construct that you need
     a Functor dictionary. Yet these extra dictionaries were
     often never used.  Test T3064 compiled *far* faster after
     silent superclasses were eliminated.

Our solution to this problem "silent superclass arguments".  We pass
to each dfun some ``silent superclass arguments’’, which are the
immediate superclasses of the dictionary we are trying to
construct. In our example:
       dfun :: forall a. C [a] -> D [a] -> D [a]
       dfun = \(dc::C [a]) (dd::D [a]) -> DOrd dc ...
Notice the extra (dc :: C [a]) argument compared to the previous version.

This gives us:

     -----------------------------------------------------------
     DFun Superclass Invariant
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     In the body of a DFun, every superclass argument to the
     returned dictionary is
       either   * one of the arguments of the DFun,
       or       * constant, bound at top level
     -----------------------------------------------------------

This net effect is that it is safe to treat a dfun application as
wrapping a dictionary constructor around its arguments (in particular,
a dfun never picks superclasses from the arguments under the
dictionary constructor). No superclass is hidden inside a dfun
application.

The extra arguments required to satisfy the DFun Superclass Invariant
always come first, and are called the "silent" arguments.  You can
find out how many silent arguments there are using Id.dfunNSilent;
and then you can just drop that number of arguments to see the ones
that were in the original instance declaration.

DFun types are built (only) by MkId.mkDictFunId, so that is where we
decide what silent arguments are to be added.

tcMethod
- Make the method bindings, as a [(NonRec, HsBinds)], one per method
- Remembering to use fresh Name (the instance method Name) as the binder
- Bring the instance method Ids into scope, for the benefit of tcInstSig
- Use sig_fn mapping instance method Name -> instance tyvars
- Ditto prag_fn
- Use tcValBinds to do the checking

Note [Mismatched class methods and associated type families]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's entirely possible for someone to put methods or associated type family
instances inside of a class in which it doesn't belong. For instance, we'd
want to fail if someone wrote this:

  instance Eq () where
    type Rep () = Maybe
    compare = undefined

Since neither the type family `Rep` nor the method `compare` belong to the
class `Eq`. Normally, this is caught in the renamer when resolving RdrNames,
since that would discover that the parent class `Eq` is incorrect.

However, there is a scenario in which the renamer could fail to catch this:
if the instance was generated through Template Haskell, as in #12387. In that
case, Template Haskell will provide fully resolved names (e.g.,
`GHC.Classes.compare`), so the renamer won't notice the sleight-of-hand going
on. For this reason, we also put an extra validity check for this in the
typechecker as a last resort.

Note [Avoid -Winaccessible-code when deriving]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Winaccessible-code can be particularly noisy when deriving instances for
GADTs. Consider the following example (adapted from #8128):

  data T a where
    MkT1 :: Int -> T Int
    MkT2 :: T Bool
    MkT3 :: T Bool
  deriving instance Eq (T a)
  deriving instance Ord (T a)

In the derived Ord instance, GHC will generate the following code:

  instance Ord (T a) where
    compare x y
      = case x of
          MkT2
            -> case y of
                 MkT1 {} -> GT
                 MkT2    -> EQ
                 _       -> LT
          ...

However, that MkT1 is unreachable, since the type indices for MkT1 and MkT2
differ, so if -Winaccessible-code is enabled, then deriving this instance will
result in unwelcome warnings.

One conceivable approach to fixing this issue would be to change `deriving Ord`
such that it becomes smarter about not generating unreachable cases. This,
however, would be a highly nontrivial refactor, as we'd have to propagate
through typing information everywhere in the algorithm that generates Ord
instances in order to determine which cases were unreachable. This seems like
a lot of work for minimal gain, so we have opted not to go for this approach.

Instead, we take the following approach:

1. In tcMethods (which typechecks method bindings), use 'setInGeneratedCode'.
2. When creating Implications during typechecking, record this flag
   (in ic_warn_inaccessible) at the time of creation.
3. After typechecking comes error reporting, where GHC must decide how to
   report inaccessible code to the user, on an Implication-by-Implication
   basis. If the ic_warn_inaccessible field of the Implication is False, then
   we don't bother reporting it. That's it!

{- Note [Instance method signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With -XInstanceSigs we allow the user to supply a signature for the
method in an instance declaration.  Here is an artificial example:

       data T a = MkT a
       instance Ord a => Ord (T a) where
         (>) :: forall b. b -> b -> Bool
         (>) = error "You can't compare Ts"

The instance signature can be *more* polymorphic than the instantiated
class method (in this case: Age -> Age -> Bool), but it cannot be less
polymorphic.  Moreover, if a signature is given, the implementation
code should match the signature, and type variables bound in the
signature should scope over the method body.

We achieve this by building a TcSigInfo for the method, whether or not
there is an instance method signature, and using that to typecheck
the declaration (in tcMethodBody).  That means, conveniently,
that the type variables bound in the signature will scope over the body.

What about the check that the instance method signature is more
polymorphic than the instantiated class method type?  We just do a
tcSubType call in tcMethodBodyHelp, and generate a nested AbsBind, like
this (for the example above

 AbsBind { abs_tvs = [a], abs_ev_vars = [d:Ord a]
         , abs_exports
             = ABExport { (>) :: forall a. Ord a => T a -> T a -> Bool
                        , gr_lcl :: T a -> T a -> Bool }
         , abs_binds
             = AbsBind { abs_tvs = [], abs_ev_vars = []
                       , abs_exports = ABExport { gr_lcl :: T a -> T a -> Bool
                                                , gr_inner :: forall b. b -> b -> Bool }
                       , abs_binds = AbsBind { abs_tvs = [b], abs_ev_vars = []
                                             , ..etc.. }
               } }

Wow!  Three nested AbsBinds!
 * The outer one abstracts over the tyvars and dicts for the instance
 * The middle one is only present if there is an instance signature,
   and does the impedance matching for that signature
 * The inner one is for the method binding itself against either the
   signature from the class, or the instance signature.

Note [Export helper functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We arrange to export the "helper functions" of an instance declaration,
so that they are not subject to preInlineUnconditionally, even if their
RHS is trivial.  Reason: they are mentioned in the DFunUnfolding of
the dict fun as Ids, not as CoreExprs, so we can't substitute a
non-variable for them.

We could change this by making DFunUnfoldings have CoreExprs, but it
seems a bit simpler this way.

Note [Default methods in instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this

   class Baz v x where
      foo :: x -> x
      foo y = <blah>

   instance Baz Int Int

From the class decl we get

   $dmfoo :: forall v x. Baz v x => x -> x
   $dmfoo y = <blah>

Notice that the type is ambiguous.  So we use Visible Type Application
to disambiguate:

   $dBazIntInt = MkBaz fooIntInt
   fooIntInt = $dmfoo @Int @Int

Lacking VTA we'd get ambiguity errors involving the default method.  This applies
equally to vanilla default methods (#1061) and generic default methods
(#12220).

Historical note: before we had VTA we had to generate
post-type-checked code, which took a lot more code, and didn't work for
generic default methods.

Note [INLINE and default methods]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default methods need special case.  They are supposed to behave rather like
macros.  For example

  class Foo a where
    op1, op2 :: Bool -> a -> a

    {-# INLINE op1 #-}
    op1 b x = op2 (not b) x

  instance Foo Int where
    -- op1 via default method
    op2 b x = <blah>

The instance declaration should behave

   just as if 'op1' had been defined with the
   code, and INLINE pragma, from its original
   definition.

That is, just as if you'd written

  instance Foo Int where
    op2 b x = <blah>

    {-# INLINE op1 #-}
    op1 b x = op2 (not b) x

So for the above example we generate:

  {-# INLINE $dmop1 #-}
  -- $dmop1 has an InlineCompulsory unfolding
  $dmop1 d b x = op2 d (not b) x

  $fFooInt = MkD $cop1 $cop2

  {-# INLINE $cop1 #-}
  $cop1 = $dmop1 $fFooInt

  $cop2 = <blah>

Note carefully:

* We *copy* any INLINE pragma from the default method $dmop1 to the
  instance $cop1.  Otherwise we'll just inline the former in the
  latter and stop, which isn't what the user expected

* Regardless of its pragma, we give the default method an
  unfolding with an InlineCompulsory source. That means
  that it'll be inlined at every use site, notably in
  each instance declaration, such as $cop1.  This inlining
  must happen even though
    a) $dmop1 is not saturated in $cop1
    b) $cop1 itself has an INLINE pragma

  It's vital that $dmop1 *is* inlined in this way, to allow the mutual
  recursion between $fooInt and $cop1 to be broken

* To communicate the need for an InlineCompulsory to the desugarer
  (which makes the Unfoldings), we use the IsDefaultMethod constructor
  in TcSpecPrags.

Note [SPECIALISE instance pragmas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

   instance (Ix a, Ix b) => Ix (a,b) where
     {-# SPECIALISE instance Ix (Int,Int) #-}
     range (x,y) = ...

We make a specialised version of the dictionary function, AND
specialised versions of each *method*.  Thus we should generate
something like this:

  $dfIxPair :: (Ix a, Ix b) => Ix (a,b)
  {-# DFUN [$crangePair, ...] #-}
  {-# SPECIALISE $dfIxPair :: Ix (Int,Int) #-}
  $dfIxPair da db = Ix ($crangePair da db) (...other methods...)

  $crange :: (Ix a, Ix b) -> ((a,b),(a,b)) -> [(a,b)]
  {-# SPECIALISE $crange :: ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> [(Int,Int)] #-}
  $crange da db = <blah>

The SPECIALISE pragmas are acted upon by the desugarer, which generate

  dii :: Ix Int
  dii = ...

  $s$dfIxPair :: Ix ((Int,Int),(Int,Int))
  {-# DFUN [$crangePair di di, ...] #-}
  $s$dfIxPair = Ix ($crangePair di di) (...)

  {-# RULE forall (d1,d2:Ix Int). $dfIxPair Int Int d1 d2 = $s$dfIxPair #-}

  $s$crangePair :: ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> [(Int,Int)]
  $c$crangePair = ...specialised RHS of $crangePair...

  {-# RULE forall (d1,d2:Ix Int). $crangePair Int Int d1 d2 = $s$crangePair #-}

Note that

  * The specialised dictionary $s$dfIxPair is very much needed, in case we
    call a function that takes a dictionary, but in a context where the
    specialised dictionary can be used.  See #7797.

  * The ClassOp rule for 'range' works equally well on $s$dfIxPair, because
    it still has a DFunUnfolding.  See Note [ClassOp/DFun selection]

  * A call (range ($dfIxPair Int Int d1 d2)) might simplify two ways:
       --> {ClassOp rule for range}     $crangePair Int Int d1 d2
       --> {SPEC rule for $crangePair}  $s$crangePair
    or thus:
       --> {SPEC rule for $dfIxPair}    range $s$dfIxPair
       --> {ClassOpRule for range}      $s$crangePair
    It doesn't matter which way.

  * We want to specialise the RHS of both $dfIxPair and $crangePair,
    but the SAME HsWrapper will do for both!  We can call tcSpecPrag
    just once, and pass the result (in spec_inst_info) to tcMethods.
