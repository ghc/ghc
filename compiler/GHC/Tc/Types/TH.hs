{- Note [RunSplice ThLevel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'RunSplice' stage is set when executing a splice, and only when running a
splice. In particular it is not set when the splice is renamed or typechecked.

However, this is not true. `reifyInstances` for example does rename the given type,
and these types may contain variables (#9262 allow free variables in reifyInstances).
Therefore here we assume that thLevel (RunSplice _) = 0.
Proper fix would probably require renaming argument `reifyInstances` separately prior
to evaluation of the overall splice.

'RunSplice' is needed to provide a reference where 'addModFinalizer' can insert
the finalizer (see Note [Delaying modFinalizers in untyped splices]), and
'addModFinalizer' runs when doing Q things. Therefore, It doesn't make sense to
set 'RunSplice' when renaming or typechecking the splice, where 'Splice',
'Brack' or 'Comp' are used instead.
