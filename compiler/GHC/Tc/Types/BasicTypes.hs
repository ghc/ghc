{- Note [Complete and partial type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A type signature is partial when it contains one or more wildcards
(= type holes).  The wildcard can either be:
* A (type) wildcard occurring in sig_theta or sig_tau. These are
  stored in sig_wcs.
      f :: Bool -> _
      g :: Eq _a => _a -> _a -> Bool
* Or an extra-constraints wildcard, stored in sig_cts:
      h :: (Num a, _) => a -> a

A type signature is a complete type signature when there are no
wildcards in the type signature, i.e. iff sig_wcs is empty and
sig_extra_cts is Nothing.

         }

{- Note [sig_inst_tau may be polymorphic]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that "sig_inst_tau" might actually be a polymorphic type,
if the original function had a signature like
   forall a. Eq a => forall b. Ord b => ....
But that's ok: tcFunBindMatches (called by tcRhs) can deal with that
It happens, too!  See Note [Polymorphic methods] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Class.

Note [Quantified variables in partial type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: forall a b. _ -> a -> _ -> b
   f (x,y) p q = q

Then we expect f's final type to be
  f :: forall {x,y}. forall a b. (x,y) -> a -> b -> b

Note that x,y are Inferred, and can't be use for visible type
application (VTA).  But a,b are Specified, and remain Specified
in the final type, so we can use VTA for them.  (Exception: if
it turns out that a's kind mentions b we need to reorder them
with scopedSort.)

The sig_inst_skols of the TISI from a partial signature records
that original order, and is used to get the variables of f's
final type in the correct order.


Note [Wildcards in partial signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The wildcards in psig_wcs may stand for a type mentioning
the universally-quantified tyvars of psig_ty

E.g.  f :: forall a. _ -> a
      f x = x
We get sig_inst_skols = [a]
       sig_inst_tau   = _22 -> a
       sig_inst_wcs   = [_22]
and _22 in the end is unified with the type 'a'

Moreover the kind of a wildcard in sig_inst_wcs may mention
the universally-quantified tyvars sig_inst_skols
e.g.   f :: t a -> t _
Here we get
   sig_inst_skols = [k:*, (t::k ->*), (a::k)]
   sig_inst_tau   = t a -> t _22
   sig_inst_wcs   = [ _22::k ]

  -- See Note [Meaning of IdBindingInfo]

{- Note [Meaning of IdBindingInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NotLetBound means that
  the Id is not let-bound (e.g. it is bound in a
  lambda-abstraction or in a case pattern)

ClosedLet means that
   - The Id is let-bound,
   - Any free term variables are also Global or ClosedLet
   - Its type has no free variables (NB: a top-level binding subject
     to the MR might have free vars in its type)
   These ClosedLets can definitely be floated to top level; and we
   may need to do so for static forms.

   Property:   ClosedLet
             is equivalent to
               NonClosedLet emptyNameSet True

(NonClosedLet (fvs::RhsNames) (cl::ClosedTypeId)) means that
   - The Id is let-bound

   - The fvs::RhsNames contains the free names of the RHS,
     excluding Global and ClosedLet ones.

   - For the ClosedTypeId field see Note [Bindings with closed types: ClosedTypeId]

For (static e) to be valid, we need for every 'x' free in 'e',
that x's binding is floatable to the top level.  Specifically:
   * x's RhsNames must be empty
   * x's type has no free variables
See Note [Grand plan for static forms] in "GHC.Iface.Tidy.StaticPtrTable".
This test is made in GHC.Tc.Gen.Expr.checkClosedInStaticForm.
Actually knowing x's RhsNames (rather than just its emptiness
or otherwise) is just so we can produce better error messages

Note [Bindings with closed types: ClosedTypeId]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f x = let g ys = map not ys
        in ...

Can we generalise 'g' under the OutsideIn algorithm?  Yes,
because all g's free variables are top-level; that is they themselves
have no free type variables, and it is the type variables in the
environment that makes things tricky for OutsideIn generalisation.

Here's the invariant:
   If an Id has ClosedTypeId=True (in its IdBindingInfo), then
   the Id's type is /definitely/ closed (has no free type variables).
   Specifically,
       a) The Id's actual type is closed (has no free tyvars)
       b) Either the Id has a (closed) user-supplied type signature
          or all its free variables are Global/ClosedLet
             or NonClosedLet with ClosedTypeId=True.
          In particular, none are NotLetBound.

Why is (b) needed?   Consider
    \x. (x :: Int, let y = x+1 in ...)
Initially x::alpha.  If we happen to typecheck the 'let' before the
(x::Int), y's type will have a free tyvar; but if the other way round
it won't.  So we treat any let-bound variable with a free
non-let-bound variable as not ClosedTypeId, regardless of what the
free vars of its type actually are.

But if it has a signature, all is well:
   \x. ...(let { y::Int; y = x+1 } in
           let { v = y+2 } in ...)...
Here the signature on 'v' makes 'y' a ClosedTypeId, so we can
generalise 'v'.

Note that:

  * A top-level binding may not have ClosedTypeId=True, if it suffers
    from the MR

  * A nested binding may be closed (eg 'g' in the example we started
    with). Indeed, that's the point; whether a function is defined at
    top level or nested is orthogonal to the question of whether or
    not it is closed.

  * A binding may be non-closed because it mentions a lexically scoped
    *type variable*  Eg
        f :: forall a. blah
        f x = let g y = ...(y::a)...

Under OutsideIn we are free to generalise an Id all of whose free
variables have ClosedTypeId=True (or imported).  This is an extension
compared to the JFP paper on OutsideIn, which used "top-level" as a
proxy for "closed".  (It's not a good proxy anyway -- the MR can make
a top-level binding with a free type variable.)

Note [Type variables in the type environment]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The type environment has a binding for each lexically-scoped
type variable that is in scope.  For example

  f :: forall a. a -> a
  f x = (x :: a)

  g1 :: [a] -> a
  g1 (ys :: [b]) = head ys :: b

  g2 :: [Int] -> Int
  g2 (ys :: [c]) = head ys :: c

* The forall'd variable 'a' in the signature scopes over f's RHS.

* The pattern-bound type variable 'b' in 'g1' scopes over g1's
  RHS; note that it is bound to a skolem 'a' which is not itself
  lexically in scope.

* The pattern-bound type variable 'c' in 'g2' is bound to
  Int; that is, pattern-bound type variables can stand for
  arbitrary types. (see
    GHC proposal #128 "Allow ScopedTypeVariables to refer to types"
    https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/128,
  and the paper
    "Type variables in patterns", Haskell Symposium 2018.


This is implemented by the constructor
   ATcTyVar Name TcTyVar
in the type environment.

* The Name is the name of the original, lexically scoped type
  variable

* The TcTyVar is sometimes a skolem (like in 'f'), and sometimes
  a unification variable (like in 'g1', 'g2').  We never zonk the
  type environment so in the latter case it always stays as a
  unification variable, although that variable may be later
  unified with a type (such as Int in 'g2').
