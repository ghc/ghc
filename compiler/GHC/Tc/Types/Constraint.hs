--------------- EqCt --------------

{- Note [Canonical equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An EqCt is a canonical equality constraint, one that can live in the inert set,
and that can be used to rewrite other constrtaints. It satisfies these invariants:
  * (TyEq:OC) lhs does not occur in rhs (occurs check)
              Note [EqCt occurs check]
  * (TyEq:F) rhs has no foralls
      (this avoids substituting a forall for the tyvar in other types)
  * (TyEq:K) typeKind lhs `tcEqKind` typeKind rhs; Note [Ct kind invariant]
  * (TyEq:N) If the equality is representational, rhs is not headed by a saturated
    application of a newtype TyCon. See GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality
    Note [No top-level newtypes on RHS of representational equalities].
    (Applies only when constructor of newtype is in scope.)
  * (TyEq:U) An EqCt is not immediately unifiable. If we can unify a:=ty, we
    will not form an EqCt (a ~ ty).
  * (TyEq:CH) rhs does not mention any coercion holes that resulted from fixing up
    a hetero-kinded equality.  See Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds] in
    GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality, wrinkle (EIK2)

These invariants ensure that the EqCts in inert_eqs constitute a terminating
generalised substitution. See Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities]
in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet for what these words mean!

Note [EqCt occurs check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A CEqCan relates a CanEqLHS (a type variable or type family applications) on
its left to an arbitrary type on its right. It is used for rewriting.
Because it is used for rewriting, it would be disastrous if the RHS
were to mention the LHS: this would cause a loop in rewriting.

We thus perform an occurs-check. There is, of course, some subtlety:

* For type variables, the occurs-check looks deeply including kinds of
  type variables. This is because a CEqCan over a meta-variable is
  also used to inform unification, in
  GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.checkTouchableTyVarEq. If the LHS appears
  anywhere in the RHS, at all, unification will create an infinite
  structure which is bad.

* For type family applications, the occurs-check is shallow; it looks
  only in places where we might rewrite. (Specifically, it does not
  look in kinds or coercions.) An occurrence of the LHS in, say, an
  RHS coercion is OK, as we do not rewrite in coercions. No loop to
  be found.

  You might also worry about the possibility that a type family
  application LHS doesn't exactly appear in the RHS, but something
  that reduces to the LHS does. Yet that can't happen: the RHS is
  already inert, with all type family redexes reduced. So a simple
  syntactic check is just fine.

The occurs check is performed in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.checkTyEqRhs
and forms condition T3 in Note [Extending the inert equalities]
in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

{- Note [CIrredCan constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CIrredCan constraints are used for constraints that are "stuck"
   - we can't solve them (yet)
   - we can't use them to solve other constraints
   - but they may become soluble if we substitute for some
     of the type variables in the constraint

Example 1:  (c Int), where c :: * -> Constraint.  We can't do anything
            with this yet, but if later c := Num, *then* we can solve it

Example 2:  a ~ b, where a :: *, b :: k, where k is a kind variable
            We don't want to use this to substitute 'b' for 'a', in case
            'k' is subsequently unified with (say) *->*, because then
            we'd have ill-kinded types floating about.  Rather we want
            to defer using the equality altogether until 'k' get resolved.

Note [Ct/evidence invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  ct :: Ct, then extra fields of 'ct' cache precisely the ctev_pred field
of (cc_ev ct), and is fully rewritten wrt the substitution.   Eg for DictCt,
   ctev_pred (di_ev ct) = (di_cls ct) (di_tys ct)
This holds by construction; look at the unique place where DictCt is
built (in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.canDictNC).

Note [Ct kind invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CEqCan requires that the kind of the lhs matches the kind
of the rhs. This is necessary because these constraints are used for substitutions
during solving. If the kinds differed, then the substitution would take a well-kinded
type to an ill-kinded one.

Note [Holes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Note explains how GHC tracks *holes*.

A hole represents one of two conditions:
 - A missing bit of an expression. Example: foo x = x + _
 - A missing bit of a type. Example: bar :: Int -> _

What these have in common is that both cause GHC to emit a diagnostic to the
user describing the bit that is left out.

When a hole is encountered, a new entry of type Hole is added to the ambient
WantedConstraints. The type (hole_ty) of the hole is then simplified during
solving (with respect to any Givens in surrounding implications). It is
reported with all the other errors in GHC.Tc.Errors.

For expression holes, the user has the option of deferring errors until runtime
with -fdefer-type-errors. In this case, the hole actually has evidence: this
evidence is an erroring expression that prints an error and crashes at runtime.
The ExprHole variant of holes stores an IORef EvTerm that will contain this evidence;
during constraint generation, this IORef was stored in the HsUnboundVar extension
field by the type checker. The desugarer simply dereferences to get the CoreExpr.

Prior to fixing #17812, we used to invent an Id to hold the erroring
expression, and then bind it during type-checking. But this does not support
representation-polymorphic out-of-scope identifiers. See
typecheck/should_compile/T17812. We thus use the mutable-CoreExpr approach
described above.

You might think that the type in the HoleExprRef is the same as the type of the
hole. However, because the hole type (hole_ty) is rewritten with respect to
givens, this might not be the case. That is, the hole_ty is always (~) to the
type of the HoleExprRef, but they might not be `eqType`. We need the type of the generated
evidence to match what is expected in the context of the hole, and so we must
store these types separately.

Type-level holes have no evidence at all.

{- Note [Custom type errors in constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When GHC reports a type-error about an unsolved-constraint, we check
to see if the constraint contains any custom-type errors, and if so
we report them.  Here are some examples of constraints containing type
errors:

TypeError msg           -- The actual constraint is a type error

TypError msg ~ Int      -- Some type was supposed to be Int, but ended up
                        -- being a type error instead

Eq (TypeError msg)      -- A class constraint is stuck due to a type error

F (TypeError msg) ~ a   -- A type function failed to evaluate due to a type err

It is also possible to have constraints where the type error is nested deeper,
for example see #11990, and also:

Eq (F (TypeError msg))  -- Here the type error is nested under a type-function
                        -- call, which failed to evaluate because of it,
                        -- and so the `Eq` constraint was unsolved.
                        -- This may happen when one function calls another
                        -- and the called function produced a custom type error.

First read Note [The superclass story] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict

We expand superclasses and iterate only if there is at unsolved wanted
for which expansion of superclasses (e.g. from given constraints)
might actually help. The function superClassesMightHelp tells if
doing this superclass expansion might help solve this constraint.
Note that

  * We look inside implications; maybe it'll help to expand the Givens
    at level 2 to help solve an unsolved Wanted buried inside an
    implication.  E.g.
        forall a. Ord a => forall b. [W] Eq a

  * We say "no" for implicit parameters.
    we have [W] ?x::ty, expanding superclasses won't help:
      - Superclasses can't be implicit parameters
      - If we have a [G] ?x:ty2, then we'll have another unsolved
        [W] ty ~ ty2 (from the functional dependency)
        which will trigger superclass expansion.

    It's a bit of a special case, but it's easy to do.  The runtime cost
    is low because the unsolved set is usually empty anyway (errors
    aside), and the first non-implicit-parameter will terminate the search.

    The special case is worth it (#11480, comment:2) because it
    applies to CallStack constraints, which aren't type errors. If we have
       f :: (C a) => blah
       f x = ...undefined...
    we'll get a CallStack constraint.  If that's the only unsolved
    constraint it'll eventually be solved by defaulting.  So we don't
    want to emit warnings about hitting the simplifier's iteration
    limit.  A CallStack constraint really isn't an unsolved
    constraint; it can always be solved by defaulting.

Consider (#14325, comment:)
    class (a~b) => C a b

    foo :: C a c => a -> c
    foo x = x

    hm3 :: C (f b) b => b -> f b
    hm3 x = foo x

In the RHS of hm3, from the [G] C (f b) b we get the insoluble
[G] f b ~# b.  Then we also get an unsolved [W] C b (f b).
Residual implication looks like
    forall b. C (f b) b => [G] f b ~# b
                           [W] C f (f b)

We do /not/ want to set the implication status to IC_Insoluble,
because that'll suppress reports of [W] C b (f b).  But we
may not report the insoluble [G] f b ~# b either (see Note [Given errors]
in GHC.Tc.Errors), so we may fail to report anything at all!  Yikes.

Bottom line: insolubleWC (called in GHC.Tc.Solver.setImplicationStatus)
             should ignore givens even if they are insoluble.

Note [Insoluble holes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hole constraints that ARE NOT treated as truly insoluble:
  a) type holes, arising from PartialTypeSignatures,
  b) "true" expression holes arising from TypedHoles

An "expression hole" or "type hole" isn't really an error
at all; it's a report saying "_ :: Int" here.  But an out-of-scope
variable masquerading as expression holes IS treated as truly
insoluble, so that it trumps other errors during error reporting.
Yuk!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GivenEqs data type describes the Given constraints of an implication constraint:

* NoGivenEqs: definitely no Given equalities, except perhaps let-bound skolems
  which don't count: see Note [Let-bound skolems] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet
  Examples: forall a. Eq a => ...
            forall a. (Show a, Num a) => ...
            forall a. a ~ Either Int Bool => ...  -- Let-bound skolem

* LocalGivenEqs: definitely no Given equalities that would affect principal
  types.  But may have equalities that affect only skolems of this implication
  (and hence do not affect principal types)
  Examples: forall a. F a ~ Int => ...
            forall a b. F a ~ G b => ...

* MaybeGivenEqs: may have Given equalities that would affect principal
  types
  Examples: forall. (a ~ b) => ...
            forall a. F a ~ b => ...
            forall a. c a => ...       -- The 'c' might be instantiated to (b ~)
            forall a. C a b => ....
               where class x~y => C a b
               so there is an equality in the superclass of a Given

The HasGivenEqs classifications affect two things:

* Suppressing redundant givens during error reporting; see GHC.Tc.Errors
  Note [Suppress redundant givens during error reporting]

* Floating in approximateWC.

Specifically, here's how it goes:

{- Note [Checking telescopes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When kind-checking a /user-written/ type, we might have a "bad telescope"
like this one:
  data SameKind :: forall k. k -> k -> Type
  type Foo :: forall a k (b :: k). SameKind a b -> Type

The kind of 'a' mentions 'k' which is bound after 'a'.  Oops.

One approach to doing this would be to bring each of a, k, and b into
scope, one at a time, creating a separate implication constraint for
each one, and bumping the TcLevel. This would work, because the kind
of, say, a would be untouchable when k is in scope (and the constraint
couldn't float out because k blocks it). However, it leads to terrible
error messages, complaining about skolem escape. While it is indeed a
problem of skolem escape, we can do better.

Instead, our approach is to bring the block of variables into scope
all at once, creating one implication constraint for the lot:

* We make a single implication constraint when kind-checking
  the 'forall' in Foo's kind, something like
      forall a k (b::k). { wanted constraints }

* Having solved {wanted}, before discarding the now-solved implication,
  the constraint solver checks the dependency order of the skolem
  variables (ic_skols).  This is done in setImplicationStatus.

* This check is only necessary if the implication was born from a
  'forall' in a user-written signature (the HsForAllTy case in
  GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.  If, say, it comes from checking a pattern match
  that binds existentials, where the type of the data constructor is
  known to be valid (it in tcConPat), no need for the check.

  So the check is done /if and only if/ ic_info is ForAllSkol.

* If ic_info is (ForAllSkol dt dvs), the dvs::SDoc displays the
  original, user-written type variables.

* Be careful /NOT/ to discard an implication with a ForAllSkol
  ic_info, even if ic_wanted is empty.  We must give the
  constraint solver a chance to make that bad-telescope test!  Hence
  the extra guard in emitResidualTvConstraint; see #16247

* Don't mix up inferred and explicit variables in the same implication
  constraint.  E.g.
      foo :: forall a kx (b :: kx). SameKind a b
  We want an implication
      Implic { ic_skol = [(a::kx), kx, (b::kx)], ... }
  but GHC will attempt to quantify over kx, since it is free in (a::kx),
  and it's hopelessly confusing to report an error about quantified
  variables   kx (a::kx) kx (b::kx).
  Instead, the outer quantification over kx should be in a separate
  implication. TL;DR: an explicit forall should generate an implication
  quantified only over those explicitly quantified variables.

Note [Needed evidence variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Th ic_need_evs field holds the free vars of ic_binds, and all the
ic_binds in nested implications.

  * Main purpose: if one of the ic_givens is not mentioned in here, it
    is redundant.

  * solveImplication may drop an implication altogether if it has no
    remaining 'wanteds'. But we still track the free vars of its
    evidence binds, even though it has now disappeared.

Note [Shadowing in a constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We assume NO SHADOWING in a constraint.  Specifically
 * The unification variables are all implicitly quantified at top
   level, and are all unique
 * The skolem variables bound in ic_skols are all fresh when the
   implication is created.
So we can safely substitute. For example, if we have
   forall a.  a~Int => ...(forall b. ...a...)...
we can push the (a~Int) constraint inwards in the "givens" without
worrying that 'b' might clash.

Note [Skolems in an implication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The skolems in an implication are used:

* When considering floating a constraint outside the implication in
  GHC.Tc.Solver.floatEqualities or GHC.Tc.Solver.approximateImplications
  For this, we can treat ic_skols as a set.

* When checking that a /user-specified/ forall (ic_info = ForAllSkol tvs)
  has its variables in the correct order; see Note [Checking telescopes].
  Only for these implications does ic_skols need to be a list.

Nota bene: Although ic_skols is a list, it is not necessarily
in dependency order:
- In the ic_info=ForAllSkol case, the user might have written them
  in the wrong order
- In the case of a type signature like
      f :: [a] -> [b]
  the renamer gathers the implicit "outer" forall'd variables {a,b}, but
  does not know what order to put them in.  The type checker can sort them
  into dependency order, but only after solving all the kind constraints;
  and to do that it's convenient to create the Implication!

So we accept that ic_skols may be out of order.  Think of it as a set or
(in the case of ic_info=ForAllSkol, a list in user-specified, and possibly
wrong, order.

Note [Insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the errors that we get during canonicalization are best
reported when all constraints have been simplified as much as
possible. For instance, assume that during simplification the
following constraints arise:

 [Wanted]   F alpha ~  uf1
 [Wanted]   beta ~ uf1 beta

When canonicalizing the wanted (beta ~ uf1 beta), if we eagerly fail
we will simply see a message:
    'Can't construct the infinite type  beta ~ uf1 beta'
and the user has no idea what the uf1 variable is.

Instead our plan is that we will NOT fail immediately, but:
    (1) Record the "frozen" error in the ic_insols field
    (2) Isolate the offending constraint from the rest of the inerts
    (3) Keep on simplifying/canonicalizing

At the end, we will hopefully have substituted uf1 := F alpha, and we
will be able to report a more informative error:
    'Can't construct the infinite type beta ~ F alpha beta'

Note [Implication invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The skolems of an implication have the following invariants, which are checked
by checkImplicationInvariants:

a) They are all SkolemTv TcTyVars; no TyVars, no unification variables
b) Their TcLevel matches the ic_lvl for the implication
c) Their SkolemInfo matches the implication.

Actually (c) is not quite true.  Consider
   data T a = forall b. MkT a b

In tcConDecl for MkT we'll create an implication with ic_info of
DataConSkol; but the type variable 'a' will have a SkolemInfo of
TyConSkol.  So we allow the tyvar to have a SkolemInfo of TyConFlav if
the implication SkolemInfo is DataConSkol.

Note [CtEvidence invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `ctev_pred` field of a `CtEvidence` is a just a cache for the type
of the evidence. More precisely:

* For Givens, `ctev_pred` = `varType ctev_evar`
* For Wanteds, `ctev_pred` = `evDestType ctev_dest`

where

  evDestType :: TcEvDest -> TcType
  evDestType (EvVarDest evVar)       = varType evVar
  evDestType (HoleDest coercionHole) = varType (coHoleCoVar coercionHole)

The invariant is maintained by `setCtEvPredType`, the only function that
updates the `ctev_pred` field of a `CtEvidence`.

Why is the invariant important? Because when the evidence is a coercion, it may
be used in (CastTy ty co); and then we may call `typeKind` on that type (e.g.
in the kind-check of `eqType`); and expect to see a fully zonked kind.
(This came up in test T13333, in the MR that fixed #20641, namely !6942.)

Historical Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the past we tried leaving the `ctev_evar`/`ctev_dest` field of a
constraint untouched (and hence un-zonked) on the grounds that it is
never looked at.  But in fact it is: the evidence can become part of a
type (via `CastTy ty kco`) and we may later ask the kind of that type
and expect a zonked result.  (For example, in the kind-check
of `eqType`.)

The safest thing is simply to keep `ctev_evar`/`ctev_dest` in sync
with `ctev_pred`, as stated in `Note [CtEvidence invariants]`.

Note [Bind new Givens immediately]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Givens we make new EvVars and bind them immediately. Two main reasons:
  * Gain sharing.  E.g. suppose we start with g :: C a b, where
       class D a => C a b
       class (E a, F a) => D a
    If we generate all g's superclasses as separate EvTerms we might
    get    selD1 (selC1 g) :: E a
           selD2 (selC1 g) :: F a
           selC1 g :: D a
    which we could do more economically as:
           g1 :: D a = selC1 g
           g2 :: E a = selD1 g1
           g3 :: F a = selD2 g1

  * For *coercion* evidence we *must* bind each given:
      class (a~b) => C a b where ....
      f :: C a b => ....
    Then in f's Givens we have g:(C a b) and the superclass sc(g,0):a~b.
    But that superclass selector can't (yet) appear in a coercion
    (see evTermCoercion), so the easy thing is to bind it to an Id.

So a Given has EvVar inside it rather than (as previously) an EvTerm.

Note [The rewrite-role of a constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rewrite-role of a constraint says what can rewrite that constraint:

* If the rewrite-role = Nominal, only a nominal equality can rewrite it

* If the rewrite-rule = Representational, either a nominal or
  representational equality can rewrit it.

Notice that the constraint may itself not be an equality at all.
For example, the rewrite-role of (Eq [a]) is Nominal; only nominal
equalities can rewrite it.

{- Note [eqCanRewrite]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(eqCanRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 (a CEqCan of form
lhs ~ ty) can be used to rewrite ct2.  It must satisfy the properties of
a can-rewrite relation, see Definition [Can-rewrite relation] in
GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.

With the solver handling Coercible constraints like equality constraints,
the rewrite conditions must take role into account, never allowing
a representational equality to rewrite a nominal one.

Note [Wanteds rewrite Wanteds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Should one Wanted constraint be allowed to rewrite another?

This example (along with #8450) suggests not:
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

This example suggests yes (indexed-types/should_fail/T4093a):
  type family Foo a
  f :: (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
In the ambiguity check, we get
  [G] g1 :: Foo e ~ Maybe e
  [W] w1 :: Foo alpha ~ Foo e
  [W] w2 :: Foo alpha ~ Maybe alpha
w1 gets rewritten by the Given to become
  [W] w3 :: Foo alpha ~ Maybe e
Now, the only way to make progress is to allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds.
Rewriting w3 with w2 gives us
  [W] w4 :: Maybe alpha ~ Maybe e
which will soon get us to alpha := e and thence to victory.

TL;DR we want equality saturation.

We thus want Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds in order to accept more programs,
but we don't want Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds because doing so can create
inscrutable error messages. To solve this dilemma:

* We allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, but...

* Each Wanted tracks the set of Wanteds it has been rewritten by, in its
  RewriterSet, stored in the ctev_rewriters field of the CtWanted
  constructor of CtEvidence.  (Only Wanteds have RewriterSets.)

* In error reporting, we simply suppress any errors that have been rewritten
  by /unsolved/ wanteds. This suppression happens in GHC.Tc.Errors.mkErrorItem,
  which uses GHC.Tc.Zonk.Type.zonkRewriterSet to look through any filled
  coercion holes. The idea is that we wish to report the "root cause" -- the
  error that rewrote all the others.

* We prioritise Wanteds that have an empty RewriterSet:
  see Note [Prioritise Wanteds with empty RewriterSet].

Let's continue our first example above:

  inert: [W] w1 :: a ~ Char
  work:  [W] w2 :: a ~ Bool

Because Wanteds can rewrite Wanteds, w1 will rewrite w2, yielding

  inert: [W] w1 :: a ~ Char
         [W] w2 {w1}:: Char ~ Bool

The {w1} in the second line of output is the RewriterSet of w1.

A RewriterSet is just a set of unfilled CoercionHoles. This is sufficient
because only equalities (evidenced by coercion holes) are used for rewriting;
other (dictionary) constraints cannot ever rewrite. The rewriter (in
e.g. GHC.Tc.Solver.Rewrite.rewrite) tracks and returns a RewriterSet,
consisting of the evidence (a CoercionHole) for any Wanted equalities used in
rewriting.  Then GHC.Tc.Solver.Solve.rewriteEvidence and
GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.rewriteEqEvidence add this RewriterSet to the rewritten
constraint's rewriter set.

Note [Prioritise Wanteds with empty RewriterSet]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When extending the WorkList, in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.extendWorkListEq,
we priorities constraints that have no rewriters. Here's why.

Consider this, which came up in T22793:
  inert: {}
  work list: [W] co_ayf : awq ~ awo
  work item: [W] co_ayb : awq ~ awp

  ==> {just put work item in inert set}
  inert: co_ayb : awq ~ awp
  work list: {}
  work: [W] co_ayf : awq ~ awo

  ==> {rewrite ayf with co_ayb}
  work list: {}
  inert: co_ayb : awq ~ awp
         co_aym{co_ayb} : awp ~ awo
                ^ rewritten by ayb

  ----- start again in simplify_loop in Solver.hs -----
  inert: {}
  work list: [W] co_ayb : awq ~ awp
  work: co_aym{co_ayb} : awp ~ awo

  ==> {add to inert set}
  inert: co_aym{co_ayb} : awp ~ awo
  work list: {}
  work: co_ayb : awq ~ awp

  ==> {rewrite co_ayb}
  inert: co_aym{co_ayb} : awp ~ awo
         co_ayp{co_aym} : awq ~ awo
  work list: {}

Now both wanteds have been rewriten by the other! This happened because
in our simplify_loop iteration, we happened to start with co_aym. All would have
been well if we'd started with the (not-rewritten) co_ayb and gotten it into the
inert set.

With that in mind, we /prioritise/ the work-list to put constraints
with no rewriters first.  This prioritisation is done in
GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.extendWorkListEq, and extendWorkListEqs.

Wrinkles

(WRW1) Before checking for an empty RewriterSet, we zonk the RewriterSet,
  because some of those CoercionHoles may have been filled in since we last
  looked: see GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.emitWork.

(WRW2) Despite the prioritisation, it is hard to be /certain/ that we can't end up
  in a situation where all of the Wanteds have rewritten each other. In
  order to report /some/ error in this case, we simply report all the
  Wanteds. The user will get a perhaps-confusing error message, but they've
  written a confusing program!  (T22707 and T22793 were close, but they do
  not exhibit this behaviour.)  So belt and braces: see the `suppress`
  stuff in GHC.Tc.Errors.mkErrorItem.

Note [Avoiding rewriting cycles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet describes
the can-rewrite relation among CtFlavour/Role pairs, saying which constraints
can rewrite which other constraints. It puts forth (R2):
  (R2) If f1 >= f, and f2 >= f,
       then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1
The naive can-rewrite relation says that (Given, Representational) can rewrite
(Wanted, Representational) and that (Wanted, Nominal) can rewrite
(Wanted, Representational), but neither of (Given, Representational) and
(Wanted, Nominal) can rewrite the other. This would violate (R2). See also
Note [Why R2?] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

To keep R2, we do not allow (Wanted, Nominal) to rewrite (Wanted, Representational).
This can, in theory, bite, in this scenario:

  type family F a
  data T a
  type role T nominal

  [G] F a ~N T a
  [W] F alpha ~N T alpha
  [W] F alpha ~R T a

As written, this makes no progress, and GHC errors. But, if we
allowed W/N to rewrite W/R, the first W could rewrite the second:

  [G] F a ~N T a
  [W] F alpha ~N T alpha
  [W] T alpha ~R T a

Now we decompose the second W to get

  [W] alpha ~N a

noting the role annotation on T. This causes (alpha := a), and then
everything else unlocks.

What to do? We could "decompose" nominal equalities into nominal-only
("NO") equalities and representational ones, where a NO equality rewrites
only nominals. That is, when considering whether [W] F alpha ~N T alpha
should rewrite [W] F alpha ~R T a, we could require splitting the first W
into [W] F alpha ~NO T alpha, [W] F alpha ~R T alpha. Then, we use the R
half of the split to rewrite the second W, and off we go. This splitting
would allow the split-off R equality to be rewritten by other equalities,
thus avoiding the problem in Note [Why R2?] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

However, note that I said that this bites in theory. That's because no
known program actually gives rise to this scenario. A direct encoding
ends up starting with

  [G] F a ~ T a
  [W] F alpha ~ T alpha
  [W] Coercible (F alpha) (T a)

where ~ and Coercible denote lifted class constraints. The ~s quickly
reduce to ~N: good. But the Coercible constraint gets rewritten to

  [W] Coercible (T alpha) (T a)

by the first Wanted. This is because Coercible is a class, and arguments
in class constraints use *nominal* rewriting, not the representational
rewriting that is restricted due to (R2). Note that reordering the code
doesn't help, because equalities (including lifted ones) are prioritized
over Coercible. Thus, I (Richard E.) see no way to write a program that
is rejected because of this infelicity. I have not proved it impossible,
exactly, but my usual tricks have not yielded results.

In the olden days, when we had Derived constraints, this Note was all
about G/R and D/N both rewriting D/R. Back then, the code in
typecheck/should_compile/T19665 really did get rejected. But now,
according to the rewriting of the Coercible constraint, the program
is accepted.

Note [SubGoalDepth]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'SubGoalDepth' takes care of stopping the constraint solver from looping.

The counter starts at zero and increases. It includes dictionary constraints,
equality simplification, and type family reduction. (Why combine these? Because
it's actually quite easy to mistake one for another, in sufficiently involved
scenarios, like ConstraintKinds.)

The flag -freduction-depth=n fixes the maximum level.

* The counter includes the depth of type class instance declarations.  Example:
     [W] d{7} : Eq [Int]
  That is d's dictionary-constraint depth is 7.  If we use the instance
     $dfEqList :: Eq a => Eq [a]
  to simplify it, we get
     d{7} = $dfEqList d'{8}
  where d'{8} : Eq Int, and d' has depth 8.

  For civilised (decidable) instance declarations, each increase of
  depth removes a type constructor from the type, so the depth never
  gets big; i.e. is bounded by the structural depth of the type.

* The counter also increments when resolving
equalities involving type functions. Example:
  Assume we have a wanted at depth 7:
    [W] d{7} : F () ~ a
  If there is a type function equation "F () = Int", this would be rewritten to
    [W] d{8} : Int ~ a
  and remembered as having depth 8.

  Again, without UndecidableInstances, this counter is bounded, but without it
  can resolve things ad infinitum. Hence there is a maximum level.

* Lastly, every time an equality is rewritten, the counter increases. Again,
  rewriting an equality constraint normally makes progress, but it's possible
  the "progress" is just the reduction of an infinitely-reducing type family.
  Hence we need to track the rewrites.

When compiling a program requires a greater depth, then GHC recommends turning
off this check entirely by setting -freduction-depth=0. This is because the
exact number that works is highly variable, and is likely to change even between
minor releases. Because this check is solely to prevent infinite compilation
times, it seems safe to disable it when a user has ascertained that their program
doesn't loop at the type level.
