{- Note [Superclass iteration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this implication constraint
    forall a.
       [W] d: C Int beta
       forall b. blah
where
  class D a b | a -> b
  class D a b => C a b
We will expand d's superclasses, giving [W] D Int beta, in the hope of geting
fundeps to unify beta.  Doing so is usually fruitless (no useful fundeps),
and if so it seems a pity to waste time iterating the implications (forall b. blah)
(If we add new Given superclasses it's a different matter: it's really worth looking
at the implications.)

Hence the definitely_redo_implications flag to simplify_loop.  It's usually
True, but False in the case where the only reason to iterate is new Wanted
superclasses.  In that case we check whether the new Wanteds actually led to
any new unifications, and iterate the implications only if so.
-}

{- Note [Expanding Recursive Superclasses and ExpansionFuel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the class declaration (T21909)

    class C [a] => C a where
       foo :: a -> Int

and suppose during type inference we obtain an implication constraint:

    forall a. C a => C [[a]]

To solve this implication constraint, we first expand one layer of the superclass
of Given constraints, but not for Wanted constraints.
(See Note [Eagerly expand given superclasses] and Note [Why adding superclasses can help]
in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.) We thus get:

    [G] g1 :: C a
    [G] g2 :: C [a]    -- new superclass layer from g1
    [W] w1 :: C [[a]]

Now, we cannot solve `w1` directly from `g1` or `g2` as we may not have
any instances for C. So we expand a layer of superclasses of each Wanteds and Givens
that we haven't expanded yet.
This is done in `maybe_simplify_again`. And we get:

    [G] g1 :: C a
    [G] g2 :: C [a]
    [G] g3 :: C [[a]]    -- new superclass layer from g2, can solve w1
    [W] w1 :: C [[a]]
    [W] w2 :: C [[[a]]]  -- new superclass layer from w1, not solvable

Now, although we can solve `w1` using `g3` (obtained from expanding `g2`),
we have a new wanted constraint `w2` (obtained from expanding `w1`) that cannot be solved.
We thus make another go at solving in `maybe_simplify_again` by expanding more
layers of superclasses. This looping is futile as Givens will never be able to catch up with Wanteds.

Side Note: In principle we don't actually need to /solve/ `w2`, as it is a superclass of `w1`
but we only expand it to expose any functional dependencies (see Note [The superclass story])
But `w2` is a wanted constraint, so we will try to solve it like any other,
even though ultimately we will discard its evidence.

Solution: Simply bound the maximum number of layers of expansion for
Givens and Wanteds, with ExpansionFuel.  Give the Givens more fuel
(say 3 layers) than the Wanteds (say 1 layer). Now the Givens will
win.  The Wanteds don't need much fuel: we are only expanding at all
to expose functional dependencies, and wantedFuel=1 means we will
expand a full recursive layer.  If the superclass hierarchy is
non-recursive (the normal case) one layer is therefore full expansion.

The default value for wantedFuel = Constants.max_WANTEDS_FUEL = 1.
The default value for givenFuel  = Constants.max_GIVENS_FUEL = 3.
Both are configurable via the `-fgivens-fuel` and `-fwanteds-fuel`
compiler flags.

There are two preconditions for the default fuel values:
   (1) default givenFuel >= default wantedsFuel
   (2) default givenFuel < solverIterations

Precondition (1) ensures that we expand givens at least as many times as we expand wanted constraints
preferably givenFuel > wantedsFuel to avoid issues like T21909 while
the precondition (2) ensures that we do not reach the solver iteration limit and fail with a
more meaningful error message (see T19627)

This also applies for quantified constraints; see `-fqcs-fuel` compiler flag and `QCI.qci_pend_sc` field.

Instance declarations are special in two ways:

  The context (Add a b ab) for the instance is clearly unused in terms

  needed!  With the context, a wanted constraint

  we will reduce to (Add Zero beta Zero), and thence we get beta := Zero.
  But without the context we won't find beta := Zero.

  This only matters in instance declarations.

* We don't report givens that are a superclass of another given. E.g.
       class Ord r => UserOfRegs r a where ...
       instance (Ord r, UserOfRegs r CmmReg) => UserOfRegs r CmmExpr where
  The (Ord r) is not redundant, even though it is a superclass of
  (UserOfRegs r CmmReg).  See Note [Recursive superclasses] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance.

  Again this is specific to instance declarations.

{- Note [Delete dead Given evidence bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a result of superclass expansion, we speculatively
generate evidence bindings for Givens. E.g.
   f :: (a ~ b) => a -> b -> Bool
   f x y = ...
We'll have
   [G] d1 :: (a~b)
and we'll speculatively generate the evidence binding
   [G] d2 :: (a ~# b) = sc_sel d

Now d2 is available for solving.  But it may not be needed!  Usually
such dead superclass selections will eventually be dropped as dead
code, but:

 * It won't always be dropped (#13032).  In the case of an
   unlifted-equality superclass like d2 above, we generate
       case heq_sc d1 of d2 -> ...
   and we can't (in general) drop that case expression in case
   d1 is bottom.  So it's technically unsound to have added it
   in the first place.

 * Simply generating all those extra superclasses can generate lots of
   code that has to be zonked, only to be discarded later.  Better not
   to generate it in the first place.

   Moreover, if we simplify this implication more than once
   (e.g. because we can't solve it completely on the first iteration
   of simpl_loop), we'll generate all the same bindings AGAIN!

Easy solution: take advantage of the work we are doing to track dead
(unused) Givens, and use it to prune the Given bindings too.  This is
all done by neededEvVars.

This led to a remarkable 25% overall compiler allocation decrease in
test T12227.

But we don't get to discard all redundant equality superclasses, alas;
see #15205.

Note [Do not simplify ConstraintHoles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before printing the inferred value for a type hole (a _ wildcard in
a partial type signature), we simplify it w.r.t. any Givens. This
makes for an easier-to-understand diagnostic for the user.

However, we do not wish to do this for extra-constraint holes. Here is
the example for why (partial-sigs/should_compile/T12844):

  bar :: _ => FooData rngs
  bar = foo

  data FooData rngs

  class Foo xs where foo :: (Head xs ~ '(r,r')) => FooData xs

  type family Head (xs :: [k]) where Head (x ': xs) = x

GHC correctly infers that the extra-constraints wildcard on `bar`
should be (Head rngs ~ '(r, r'), Foo rngs). It then adds this
constraint as a Given on the implication constraint for `bar`. (This
implication is emitted by emitResidualConstraints.) The Hole for the _
is stored within the implication's WantedConstraints.  When
simplifyHoles is called, that constraint is already assumed as a
Given. Simplifying with respect to it turns it into ('(r, r') ~ '(r,
r'), Foo rngs), which is disastrous.

Furthermore, there is no need to simplify here: extra-constraints wildcards
are filled in with the output of the solver, in chooseInferredQuantifiers
(choose_psig_context), so they are already simplified. (Contrast to normal
type holes, which are just bound to a meta-variable.) Avoiding the poor output
is simple: just don't simplify extra-constraints wildcards.

This is the only reason we need to track ConstraintHole separately
from TypeHole in HoleSort.

See also Note [Extra-constraint holes in partial type signatures]
in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.

Note [Tracking redundant constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With Opt_WarnRedundantConstraints, GHC can report which
constraints of a type signature (or instance declaration) are
redundant, and can be omitted.  Here is an overview of how it
works.

This is all tested in typecheck/should_compile/T20602 (among
others).

----- What is a redundant constraint?

* The things that can be redundant are precisely the Given
  constraints of an implication.

* A constraint can be redundant in two different ways:
  a) It is not needed by the Wanted constraints covered by the
     implication E.g.
       f :: Eq a => a -> Bool
       f x = True  -- Equality not used
  b) It is implied by other givens.  E.g.
       f :: (Eq a, Ord a)     => blah   -- Eq a unnecessary
       g :: (Eq a, a~b, Eq b) => blah   -- Either Eq a or Eq b unnecessary

*  To find (a) we need to know which evidence bindings are 'wanted';
   hence the eb_is_given field on an EvBind.

*  To find (b), we use mkMinimalBySCs on the Givens to see if any
   are unnecessary.

----- How tracking works

(RC1) When two Givens are the same, we drop the evidence for the one
  that requires more superclass selectors. This is done
  according to 2(c) of Note [Replacement vs keeping] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

(RC2) The ic_need fields of an Implic records in-scope (given) evidence
  variables bound by the context, that were needed to solve this
  implication (so far).  See the declaration of Implication.

(RC3) setImplicationStatus:
  When the constraint solver finishes solving all the wanteds in
  an implication, it sets its status to IC_Solved

  - The ics_dead field, of IC_Solved, records the subset of this
    implication's ic_given that are redundant (not needed).

  - We compute which evidence variables are needed by an implication
    in setImplicationStatus.  A variable is needed if
    a) it is free in the RHS of a Wanted EvBind,
    b) it is free in the RHS of an EvBind whose LHS is needed, or
    c) it is in the ics_need of a nested implication.

  - After computing which variables are needed, we then look at the
    remaining variables for internal redundancies. This is case (b)
    from above. This is also done in setImplicationStatus.
    Note that we only look for case (b) if case (a) shows up empty,
    as exemplified below.

  - We need to be careful not to discard an implication
    prematurely, even one that is fully solved, because we might
    thereby forget which variables it needs, and hence wrongly
    report a constraint as redundant.  But we can discard it once
    its free vars have been incorporated into its parent; or if it
    simply has no free vars. This careful discarding is also
    handled in setImplicationStatus.

(RC4) We do not want to report redundant constraints for implications
  that come from quantified constraints.  Example #23323:
     data T a
     instance Show (T a) where ...  -- No context!
     foo :: forall f c. (forall a. c a => Show (f a)) => Proxy c -> f Int -> Int
     bar = foo @T @Eq

  The call to `foo` gives us
    [W] d : (forall a. Eq a => Show (T a))
  To solve this, GHC.Tc.Solver.Solve.solveForAll makes an implication constraint:
    forall a. Eq a =>  [W] ds : Show (T a)
  and because of the degnerate instance for `Show (T a)`, we don't need the `Eq a`
  constraint.  But we don't want to report it as redundant!

* Examples:

    f, g, h :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Bool
    f x = x == x
    g x = x > x
    h x = x == x && x > x

    All three will discover that they have two [G] Eq a constraints:
    one as given and one extracted from the Ord a constraint. They will
    both discard the latter, as noted above and in
    Note [Replacement vs keeping] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

    The body of f uses the [G] Eq a, but not the [G] Ord a. It will
    report a redundant Ord a using the logic for case (a).

    The body of g uses the [G] Ord a, but not the [G] Eq a. It will
    report a redundant Eq a using the logic for case (a).

    The body of h uses both [G] Ord a and [G] Eq a. Case (a) will
    thus come up with nothing redundant. But then, the case (b)
    check will discover that Eq a is redundant and report this.

    If we did case (b) even when case (a) reports something, then
    we would report both constraints as redundant for f, which is
    terrible.

----- Reporting redundant constraints

* GHC.Tc.Errors does the actual warning, in warnRedundantConstraints.

* We don't report redundant givens for *every* implication; only
  for those which reply True to GHC.Tc.Solver.warnRedundantGivens:

   - For example, in a class declaration, the default method *can*
     use the class constraint, but it certainly doesn't *have* to,
     and we don't want to report an error there.  Ditto instance decls.

   - More subtly, in a function definition
       f :: (Ord a, Ord a, Ix a) => a -> a
       f x = rhs
     we do an ambiguity check on the type (which would find that one
     of the Ord a constraints was redundant), and then we check that
     the definition has that type (which might find that both are
     redundant).  We don't want to report the same error twice, so we
     disable it for the ambiguity check.  Hence using two different
     FunSigCtxts, one with the warn-redundant field set True, and the
     other set False in
        - GHC.Tc.Gen.Bind.tcSpecPrag
        - GHC.Tc.Gen.Bind.tcTySig

  This decision is taken in setImplicationStatus, rather than GHC.Tc.Errors
  so that we can discard implication constraints that we don't need.
  So ics_dead consists only of the *reportable* redundant givens.

----- Shortcomings

Shortcoming 1.  Consider

  j :: (Eq a, a ~ b) => a -> Bool
  j x = x == x

  k :: (Eq a, b ~ a) => a -> Bool
  k x = x == x

Currently (Nov 2021), j issues no warning, while k says that b ~ a
is redundant. This is because j uses the a ~ b constraint to rewrite
everything to be in terms of b, while k does none of that. This is
ridiculous, but I (Richard E) don't see a good fix.

Shortcoming 2.  Removing a redundant constraint can cause clients to fail to
compile, by making the function more polymoprhic. Consider (#16154)

  f :: (a ~ Bool) => a -> Int
  f x = 3

  g :: String -> Int
  g s = f (read s)

The constraint in f's signature is redundant; not used to typecheck
`f`.  And yet if you remove it, `g` won't compile, because there'll
be an ambiguous variable in `g`.

1. Pick an element from the WorkList if there exists one with depth
   less than our context-stack depth.

2. Run it down the 'stage' pipeline. Stages are:
      - canonicalization
      - inert reactions
      - spontaneous reactions
      - top-level interactions
   Each stage returns a StopOrContinue and may have sideeffected
   the inerts or worklist.

   The threading of the stages is as follows:
      - If (Stop) is returned by a stage then we start again from Step 1.
      - If (ContinueWith ct) is returned by a stage, we feed 'ct' on to
        the next stage in the pipeline.
4. If the element has survived (i.e. ContinueWith x) the last stage
   then we add it in the inerts and jump back to Step 1.

If in Step 1 no such element exists, we have exceeded our context-stack
depth and will simply fail.

Note [Canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Canonicalization converts a simple constraint to a canonical form. It is
unary (i.e. treats individual constraints one at a time).

Constraints originating from user-written code come into being as
CNonCanonicals. We know nothing about these constraints. So, first:

     Classify CNonCanoncal constraints, depending on whether they
     are equalities, class predicates, or other.

Then proceed depending on the shape of the constraint. Generally speaking,
each constraint gets rewritten and then decomposed into one of several forms
(see type Ct in GHC.Tc.Types).

When an already-canonicalized constraint gets kicked out of the inert set,
it must be recanonicalized. But we know a bit about its shape from the
last time through, so we can skip the classification step.

{- Note [Quantified constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The -XQuantifiedConstraints extension allows type-class contexts like this:

  data Rose f x = Rose x (f (Rose f x))

  instance (Eq a, forall b. Eq b => Eq (f b))
        => Eq (Rose f a)  where
    (Rose x1 rs1) == (Rose x2 rs2) = x1==x2 && rs1 == rs2

Note the (forall b. Eq b => Eq (f b)) in the instance contexts.
This quantified constraint is needed to solve the
 [W] (Eq (f (Rose f x)))
constraint which arises form the (==) definition.

The wiki page is
  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/quantified-constraints
which in turn contains a link to the GHC Proposal where the change
is specified, and a Haskell Symposium paper about it.

We implement two main extensions to the design in the paper:

 1. We allow a variable in the instance head, e.g.
      f :: forall m a. (forall b. m b) => D (m a)
    Notice the 'm' in the head of the quantified constraint, not
    a class.

 2. We support superclasses to quantified constraints.
    For example (contrived):
      f :: (Ord b, forall b. Ord b => Ord (m b)) => m a -> m a -> Bool
      f x y = x==y
    Here we need (Eq (m a)); but the quantified constraint deals only
    with Ord.  But we can make it work by using its superclass.

Here are the moving parts
  * Language extension {-# LANGUAGE QuantifiedConstraints #-}
    and add it to ghc-boot-th:GHC.LanguageExtensions.Type.Extension

  * A new form of evidence, EvDFun, that is used to discharge
    such wanted constraints

  * checkValidType gets some changes to accept forall-constraints
    only in the right places.

  * Predicate.Pred gets a new constructor ForAllPred, and
    and classifyPredType analyses a PredType to decompose
    the new forall-constraints

  * GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.InertCans gets an extra field, inert_insts,
    which holds all the Given forall-constraints.  In effect,
    such Given constraints are like local instance decls.

  * When trying to solve a class constraint, via
    GHC.Tc.Solver.Instance.Class.matchInstEnv, use the InstEnv from inert_insts
    so that we include the local Given forall-constraints
    in the lookup.  (See GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.getInstEnvs.)

  * `solveForAll` deals with solving a forall-constraint.  See
       Note [Solving a Wanted forall-constraint]

  * We augment the kick-out code to kick out an inert
    forall constraint if it can be rewritten by a new
    type equality; see GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.kick_out_rewritable

Note that a quantified constraint is never /inferred/
(by GHC.Tc.Solver.simplifyInfer).  A function can only have a
quantified constraint in its type if it is given an explicit
type signature.

{- Note [Solving a Wanted forall-constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solving a wanted forall (quantified) constraint
  [W] df :: forall ab. (Eq a, Ord b) => C x a b
is delightfully easy.   Just build an implication constraint
    forall ab. (g1::Eq a, g2::Ord b) => [W] d :: C x a
and discharge df thus:
    df = /\ab. \g1 g2. let <binds> in d
where <binds> is filled in by solving the implication constraint.
All the machinery is to hand; there is little to do.

The tricky point is about termination: see #19690.  We want to maintain
the invariant (QC-INV):

  (QC-INV) Every quantified constraint returns a non-bottom dictionary

just as every top-level instance declaration guarantees to return a non-bottom
dictionary.  But as #19690 shows, it is possible to get a bottom dicionary
by superclass selection if we aren't careful.  The situation is very similar
to that described in Note [Recursive superclasses] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance;
and we use the same solution:

* Give the Givens a CtOrigin of (GivenOrigin (InstSkol IsQC head_size))
* Give the Wanted a CtOrigin of (ScOrigin IsQC NakedSc)

Both of these things are done in solveForAll.  Now the mechanism described
in Note [Solving superclass constraints] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance takes over.

Note [Solving a Given forall-constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a Given constraint
  [G] df :: forall ab. (Eq a, Ord b) => C x a b
we just add it to TcS's local InstEnv of known instances,
via addInertForall.  Then, if we look up (C x Int Bool), say,
we'll find a match in the InstEnv.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the coercion is just reflexivity then you may re-use the same
evidence variable.  But be careful!  Although the coercion is Refl, new_pred
may reflect the result of unification alpha := ty, so new_pred might
not _look_ the same as old_pred, and it's vital to proceed from now on
using new_pred.

The rewriter preserves type synonyms, so they should appear in new_pred
as well as in old_pred; that is important for good error messages.

If we are rewriting with Refl, then there are no new rewriters to add to
the rewriter set. We check this with an assertion.
