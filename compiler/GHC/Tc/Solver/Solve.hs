{- Note [Superclass iteration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this implication constraint
    forall a.
       [W] d: C Int beta
       forall b. blah
where
  class D a b | a -> b
  class D a b => C a b
We will expand d's superclasses, giving [W] D Int beta, in the hope of geting
fundeps to unify beta.  Doing so is usually fruitless (no useful fundeps),
and if so it seems a pity to waste time iterating the implications (forall b. blah)
(If we add new Given superclasses it's a different matter: it's really worth looking
at the implications.)

Hence the definitely_redo_implications flag to simplify_loop.  It's usually
True, but False in the case where the only reason to iterate is new Wanted
superclasses.  In that case we check whether the new Wanteds actually led to
any new unifications, and iterate the implications only if so.
-}

{- Note [Expanding Recursive Superclasses and ExpansionFuel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the class declaration (T21909)

    class C [a] => C a where
       foo :: a -> Int

and suppose during type inference we obtain an implication constraint:

    forall a. C a => C [[a]]

To solve this implication constraint, we first expand one layer of the superclass
of Given constraints, but not for Wanted constraints.
(See Note [Eagerly expand given superclasses] and Note [Why adding superclasses can help]
in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.) We thus get:

    [G] g1 :: C a
    [G] g2 :: C [a]    -- new superclass layer from g1
    [W] w1 :: C [[a]]

Now, we cannot solve `w1` directly from `g1` or `g2` as we may not have
any instances for C. So we expand a layer of superclasses of each Wanteds and Givens
that we haven't expanded yet.
This is done in `maybe_simplify_again`. And we get:

    [G] g1 :: C a
    [G] g2 :: C [a]
    [G] g3 :: C [[a]]    -- new superclass layer from g2, can solve w1
    [W] w1 :: C [[a]]
    [W] w2 :: C [[[a]]]  -- new superclass layer from w1, not solvable

Now, although we can solve `w1` using `g3` (obtained from expanding `g2`),
we have a new wanted constraint `w2` (obtained from expanding `w1`) that cannot be solved.
We thus make another go at solving in `maybe_simplify_again` by expanding more
layers of superclasses. This looping is futile as Givens will never be able to catch up with Wanteds.

Side Note: In principle we don't actually need to /solve/ `w2`, as it is a superclass of `w1`
but we only expand it to expose any functional dependencies (see Note [The superclass story])
But `w2` is a wanted constraint, so we will try to solve it like any other,
even though ultimately we will discard its evidence.

Solution: Simply bound the maximum number of layers of expansion for
Givens and Wanteds, with ExpansionFuel.  Give the Givens more fuel
(say 3 layers) than the Wanteds (say 1 layer). Now the Givens will
win.  The Wanteds don't need much fuel: we are only expanding at all
to expose functional dependencies, and wantedFuel=1 means we will
expand a full recursive layer.  If the superclass hierarchy is
non-recursive (the normal case) one layer is therefore full expansion.

The default value for wantedFuel = Constants.max_WANTEDS_FUEL = 1.
The default value for givenFuel  = Constants.max_GIVENS_FUEL = 3.
Both are configurable via the `-fgivens-fuel` and `-fwanteds-fuel`
compiler flags.

There are two preconditions for the default fuel values:
   (1) default givenFuel >= default wantedsFuel
   (2) default givenFuel < solverIterations

Precondition (1) ensures that we expand givens at least as many times as we expand wanted constraints
preferably givenFuel > wantedsFuel to avoid issues like T21909 while
the precondition (2) ensures that we do not reach the solver iteration limit and fail with a
more meaningful error message (see T19627)

This also applies for quantified constraints; see `-fqcs-fuel` compiler flag and `QCI.qci_pend_sc` field.

{- Note [trySolveImplication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`trySolveImplication` may be invoked while solving simple wanteds, notably from
`solveWantedForAll`.  It returns a Bool to say if solving succeeded or failed.

It uses `nestImplicTcS` to build a nested scope.  One subtle point is that
`nestImplicTcS` uses the `inert_givens` (not the `inert_cans`) of the current
inert set to initialse the `InertSet` of the nested scope.  It is super-important not
to pollute the sub-solving problem with the unsolved Wanteds of the current scope.

Whenever we do `solveSimpleGivens`, we snapshot the `inert_cans` into `inert_givens`.
(At that moment there should be no Wanteds.)

{- Note [Redundant constraints in instance decls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instance declarations are special in two ways:

* We don't report unused givens if they can give rise to improvement.
  Example (#10100):
    class Add a b ab | a b -> ab, a ab -> b
    instance Add Zero b b
    instance Add a b ab => Add (Succ a) b (Succ ab)
  The context (Add a b ab) for the instance is clearly unused in terms
  of evidence, since the dictionary has no fields.  But it is still
  needed!  With the context, a wanted constraint
     Add (Succ Zero) beta (Succ Zero)
  we will reduce to (Add Zero beta Zero), and thence we get beta := Zero.
  But without the context we won't find beta := Zero.

  This only matters in instance declarations.

* We don't report givens that are a superclass of another given. E.g.
       class Ord r => UserOfRegs r a where ...
       instance (Ord r, UserOfRegs r CmmReg) => UserOfRegs r CmmExpr where
  The (Ord r) is not redundant, even though it is a superclass of
  (UserOfRegs r CmmReg).  See Note [Recursive superclasses] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance.

  Again this is specific to instance declarations.

{- Note [Delete dead Given evidence bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a result of superclass expansion, we speculatively
generate evidence bindings for Givens. E.g.
   f :: (a ~ b) => a -> b -> Bool
   f x y = ...
We'll have
   [G] d1 :: (a~b)
and we'll speculatively generate the evidence binding
   [G] d2 :: (a ~# b) = sc_sel d

Now d2 is available for solving.  But it may not be needed!  Usually
such dead superclass selections will eventually be dropped as dead
code, but:

 * It won't always be dropped (#13032).  In the case of an
   unlifted-equality superclass like d2 above, we generate
       case heq_sc d1 of d2 -> ...
   and we can't (in general) drop that case expression in case
   d1 is bottom.  So it's technically unsound to have added it
   in the first place.

 * Simply generating all those extra superclasses can generate lots of
   code that has to be zonked, only to be discarded later.  Better not
   to generate it in the first place.

   Moreover, if we simplify this implication more than once
   (e.g. because we can't solve it completely on the first iteration
   of simpl_loop), we'll generate all the same bindings AGAIN!

Easy solution: take advantage of the work we are doing to track dead
(unused) Givens, and use it to prune the Given bindings too.  This is
all done by neededEvVars.

This led to a remarkable 25% overall compiler allocation decrease in
test T12227.

But we don't get to discard all redundant equality superclasses, alas;
see #15205.

Note [Do not simplify ConstraintHoles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before printing the inferred value for a type hole (a _ wildcard in
a partial type signature), we simplify it w.r.t. any Givens. This
makes for an easier-to-understand diagnostic for the user.

However, we do not wish to do this for extra-constraint holes. Here is
the example for why (partial-sigs/should_compile/T12844):

  bar :: _ => FooData rngs
  bar = foo

  data FooData rngs

  class Foo xs where foo :: (Head xs ~ '(r,r')) => FooData xs

  type family Head (xs :: [k]) where Head (x ': xs) = x

GHC correctly infers that the extra-constraints wildcard on `bar`
should be (Head rngs ~ '(r, r'), Foo rngs). It then adds this
constraint as a Given on the implication constraint for `bar`. (This
implication is emitted by emitResidualConstraints.) The Hole for the _
is stored within the implication's WantedConstraints.  When
simplifyHoles is called, that constraint is already assumed as a
Given. Simplifying with respect to it turns it into ('(r, r') ~ '(r,
r'), Foo rngs), which is disastrous.

Furthermore, there is no need to simplify here: extra-constraints wildcards
are filled in with the output of the solver, in chooseInferredQuantifiers
(choose_psig_context), so they are already simplified. (Contrast to normal
type holes, which are just bound to a meta-variable.) Avoiding the poor output
is simple: just don't simplify extra-constraints wildcards.

This is the only reason we need to track ConstraintHole separately
from TypeHole in HoleSort.

See also Note [Extra-constraint holes in partial type signatures]
in GHC.Tc.Gen.HsType.

Note [Tracking redundant constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With Opt_WarnRedundantConstraints, GHC can report which constraints of a type
signature (or instance declaration) are redundant, and can be omitted.  Here is
an overview of how it works.

This is all tested in typecheck/should_compile/T20602 (among others).

How tracking works:

* We maintain the `ic_need` field in an implication:
     ic_need: the set of Given evidence variables that are needed somewhere
              inside this implication; and are bound either by this implication
              or by an enclosing one.

* `setImplicationStatus` does all the work:
  - When the constraint solver finishes solving all the wanteds in
    an implication, it sets its status to IC_Solved

  - `neededEvVars`: computes which evidence variables are needed by an
    implication in `setImplicationStatus`.  A variable is needed if

      a) It is in the ic_need field of this implication, computed in
         a previous call to `setImplicationStatus`; see (TRC1)

      b) It is in the ics_need of a nested implication; see `add_implic`
         in `neededEvVars`

      c) It is free in the RHS of any /Wanted/ EvBind; each such binding
         solves a Wanted, so we want them all.  See `add_wanted` in
         `neededEvVars`

      d) It is free in the RHS of a /Given/ EvBind whose LHS is needed:
         see `findNeededGivenEvVars` called from `neededEvVars`.

  - Next, if the final status is IC_Solved, `setImplicationStatus` uses
    `findRedundantGivens` to decide which of this implication's Givens
    are redundant.

  - It also uses `pruneImplications` to discard any now-unnecessary child
    implications.

* GHC.Tc.Errors does the actual warning, in `warnRedundantConstraints`.


Wrinkles:

(TRC1) `pruneImplications` drops any sub-implications of an Implication
  that are irrelevant for error reporting:
      - no unsolved wanteds
      - no sub-implications
      - no redundant givens to report
  But in doing so we must not lose track of the variables that those implications
  needed!  So we track the ic_needs of all child implications in `ic_need_implics`.
  Crucially, this set includes things need by child implications that have been
  discarded by `pruneImplications`.

(TRC2) A Given can be redundant because it is implied by other Givens
         f :: (Eq a, Ord a)     => blah   -- Eq a unnecessary
         g :: (Eq a, a~b, Eq b) => blah   -- Either Eq a or Eq b unnecessary
   We nail this by using `mkMinimalBySCs` in `findRedundantGivens`.
   (TRC2a) But NOTE that we only attempt this mkMinimalBySCs stuff if all Givens
   used by evidence bindings.  Example:
      f :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Bool
      f x = x == x
   We report (Ord a) as unused because it is. But we must not also report (Eq a)
   as unused because it is a superclass of Ord!

(TRC3) When two Givens are the same, prefer one that does not involve superclass
  selection, or more generally has shallower superclass-selection depth:
  see 2(b,c) in Note [Replacement vs keeping] in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.
    e.g        f :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Bool
               f x = x == x
  Eager superclass expansion gives us two [G] Eq a constraints. We want to keep
  the one from the user-written Eq a, not the superclass selection. This means
  we report the Ord a as redundant with -Wredundant-constraints, not the Eq a.
  Getting this wrong was #20602.

(TRC4) We don't compute redundant givens for *every* implication; only
  for those which reply True to `warnRedundantGivens`:

   - For example, in a class declaration, the default method *can*
     use the class constraint, but it certainly doesn't *have* to,
     and we don't want to report an error there.  Ditto instance decls.

   - More subtly, in a function definition
       f :: (Ord a, Ord a, Ix a) => a -> a
       f x = rhs
     we do an ambiguity check on the type (which would find that one
     of the Ord a constraints was redundant), and then we check that
     the definition has that type (which might find that both are
     redundant).  We don't want to report the same error twice, so we
     disable it for the ambiguity check.  Hence using two different
     FunSigCtxts, one with the warn-redundant field set True, and the
     other set False in
        - GHC.Tc.Gen.Bind.tcSpecPrag
        - GHC.Tc.Gen.Bind.tcTySig

   - We do not want to report redundant constraints for implications
     that come from quantified constraints.  Example #23323:
        data T a
        instance Show (T a) where ...  -- No context!
        foo :: forall f c. (forall a. c a => Show (f a)) => Proxy c -> f Int -> Int
        bar = foo @T @Eq

     The call to `foo` gives us
       [W] d : (forall a. Eq a => Show (T a))
     To solve this, GHC.Tc.Solver.Solve.solveForAll makes an implication constraint:
       forall a. Eq a =>  [W] ds : Show (T a)
     and because of the degnerate instance for `Show (T a)`, we don't need the `Eq a`
     constraint.  But we don't want to report it as redundant!

(TRC5) Consider this (#25992), where `op2` has a default method
        class C a where { op1, op2 :: a -> a
                        ; op2 = op1 . op1 }
        instance C a => C [a] where
          op1 x = x

  Plainly the (C a) constraint is unused; but the expanded decl will look like
        $dmop2 :: C a => a -> a
        $dmop2 = op1 . op1

        $fCList :: forall a. C a => C [a]
        $fCList @a (d::C a) = MkC (\(x:a).x) ($dmop2 @a d)

   Notice that `d` gets passed to `$dmop`: it is "needed".  But it's only
   /really/ needed if some /other/ method (in this case `op1`) uses it.

   So, rather than one set of "needed Givens" we use `EvNeedSet` to track
   a /pair/ of sets:
      ens_dms: needed /only/ by default-method calls
      ens_fvs: needed by something other than a default-method call
   It's a bit of a palaver, but not really difficult.
   All the logic is localised in `neededEvVars`.

   But NOTE that this only applies to /vanilla/ default methods.
   For /generic/ default methods, like
            class D a where { op1 :: blah
                            ; default op1 :: Eq a => blah2 }
   the (Eq a) constraint really is needed (e.g. class NFData and #25992).
   Hence the `Bool` field of `MethSkol` indicates a /vanilla/ default method.

----- Examples

    f, g, h :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Bool
    f x = x == x
    g x = x > x
    h x = x == x && x > x

    All of f,g,h will discover that they have two [G] Eq a constraints: one as
    given and one extracted from the Ord a constraint. They will both discard
    the latter; see (TRC3).

    The body of f uses the [G] Eq a, but not the [G] Ord a. It will report a
    redundant Ord a.

    The body of g uses the [G] Ord a, but not the [G] Eq a. It will report a
    redundant Eq a.

    The body of h uses both [G] Ord a and [G] Eq a; each is used in a solved
    Wanted evidence binding.  But (TRC2) kicks in and discovers the Eq a
    is redundant.

----- Shortcomings

Shortcoming 1.  Consider

  j :: (Eq a, a ~ b) => a -> Bool
  j x = x == x

  k :: (Eq a, b ~ a) => a -> Bool
  k x = x == x

Currently (Nov 2021), j issues no warning, while k says that b ~ a
is redundant. This is because j uses the a ~ b constraint to rewrite
everything to be in terms of b, while k does none of that. This is
ridiculous, but I (Richard E) don't see a good fix.

Shortcoming 2.  Removing a redundant constraint can cause clients to fail to
compile, by making the function more polymorphic. Consider (#16154)

  f :: (a ~ Bool) => a -> Int
  f x = 3

  g :: String -> Int
  g s = f (read s)

The constraint in f's signature is redundant; not used to typecheck
`f`.  And yet if you remove it, `g` won't compile, because there'll
be an ambiguous variable in `g`.

   The threading of the stages is as follows:
      - If (Stop) is returned by a stage then we start again from Step 1.
      - If (ContinueWith ct) is returned by a stage, we feed 'ct' on to
        the next stage in the pipeline.
4. If the element has survived (i.e. ContinueWith x) the last stage
   then we add it in the inerts and jump back to Step 1.

If in Step 1 no such element exists, we have exceeded our context-stack
depth and will simply fail.

Note [Canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Canonicalization converts a simple constraint to a canonical form. It is
unary (i.e. treats individual constraints one at a time).

Constraints originating from user-written code come into being as
CNonCanonicals. We know nothing about these constraints. So, first:

     Classify CNonCanoncal constraints, depending on whether they
     are equalities, class predicates, or other.

Then proceed depending on the shape of the constraint. Generally speaking,
each constraint gets rewritten and then decomposed into one of several forms
(see type Ct in GHC.Tc.Types).

When an already-canonicalized constraint gets kicked out of the inert set,
it must be recanonicalized. But we know a bit about its shape from the
last time through, so we can skip the classification step.

{- Note [Quantified constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The -XQuantifiedConstraints extension allows type-class contexts like this:

  data Rose f x = Rose x (f (Rose f x))

  instance (Eq a, forall b. Eq b => Eq (f b))
        => Eq (Rose f a)  where
    (Rose x1 rs1) == (Rose x2 rs2) = x1==x2 && rs1 == rs2

Note the (forall b. Eq b => Eq (f b)) in the instance contexts.
This quantified constraint is needed to solve the
 [W] (Eq (f (Rose f x)))
constraint which arises form the (==) definition.

The wiki page is
  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/quantified-constraints
which in turn contains a link to the GHC Proposal where the change
is specified, and a Haskell Symposium paper about it.

We implement two main extensions to the design in the paper:

 1. We allow a variable in the instance head, e.g.
      f :: forall m a. (forall b. m b) => D (m a)
    Notice the 'm' in the head of the quantified constraint, not
    a class.

 2. We support superclasses to quantified constraints.
    For example (contrived):
      f :: (Ord b, forall b. Ord b => Ord (m b)) => m a -> m a -> Bool
      f x y = x==y
    Here we need (Eq (m a)); but the quantified constraint deals only
    with Ord.  But we can make it work by using its superclass.

Here are the moving parts
  * Language extension {-# LANGUAGE QuantifiedConstraints #-}
    and add it to ghc-boot-th:GHC.LanguageExtensions.Type.Extension

  * A new form of evidence, EvDFun, that is used to discharge
    such wanted constraints

  * checkValidType gets some changes to accept forall-constraints
    only in the right places.

  * Predicate.Pred gets a new constructor ForAllPred, and
    and classifyPredType analyses a PredType to decompose
    the new forall-constraints

  * GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.InertCans gets an extra field, inert_insts,
    which holds all the Given forall-constraints.  In effect,
    such Given constraints are like local instance decls.

  * When trying to solve a class constraint, via
    GHC.Tc.Solver.Instance.Class.matchInstEnv, use the InstEnv from inert_insts
    so that we include the local Given forall-constraints
    in the lookup.  (See GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.getInstEnvs.)

  * `solveForAll` deals with solving a forall-constraint.  See
       Note [Solving a Wanted forall-constraint]

  * We augment the kick-out code to kick out an inert
    forall constraint if it can be rewritten by a new
    type equality; see GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.kick_out_rewritable

Note that a quantified constraint is never /inferred/
(by GHC.Tc.Solver.simplifyInfer).  A function can only have a
quantified constraint in its type if it is given an explicit
type signature.

  [W] df :: forall a b. (Eq a, Ord b) => C x a b
is delightfully easy in principle.   Just build an implication constraint
    forall ab. (g1::Eq a, g2::Ord b) => [W] d :: C x a
and discharge df thus:
    df = /\ab. \g1 g2. let <binds> in d
where <binds> is filled in by solving the implication constraint.

We do not /actually/ emit an implication to solve later.  Rather we
try to solve it completely immediately using `trySolveImplication`
    - If successful, we can build evidence
    - If unsuccessful, we abandon the attempt and add the unsolved
      forall-constraint to the inert set.

There are several reasons for this "solve immediately" approach

* It saves quite a bit of plumbing, tracking the emitted implications for
  later solving; and the evidence would have to contain as-yet-incomplte
  bindings which complicates tracking of unused Givens.

* We get better error messages, about failing to solve, say
         (forall a. a->a) ~ (forall b. b->Int)

* Consider
    f :: forall f a. (Ix a, forall x. Eq x => Eq (f x)) => a -> f a
    {-# SPECIALISE f :: forall f. (forall x. Eq x => Eq (f x)) => Int -> f Int #-}
  This SPECIALISE is treated like an expression with a type signature, so
  we instantiate the constraints, simplify them and re-generalise.  From the
  instantiation we get  [W] d :: (forall x. Eq a => Eq (f x))
  and we want to generalise over that.  We do not want to attempt to solve it
  and then get stuck, and emit an error message.  If we can't solve it, better
  to leave it alone.

  We still need to simplify quantified constraints that can be
  /fully solved/ from instances, otherwise we would never be able to
  specialise them away. Example: {-# SPECIALISE f @[] @a #-}.

  This last point is a big one: it was the immediate driver for moving to
  the "solve immediately" approach.

You might worry about the wasted work from failed attempts to fully-solve, but
it is seldom repeated (because the constraint solver seldom iterates much).

There are some tricky corners though:

(WFA1) We can take a more straightforward path when there is a matching Given, e.g.
          [W] dg :: forall c d. (Eq c, Ord d) => C x c d
    In this case, it's better to directly solve the Wanted from the Given, instead
    of building an implication. This is more than a simple optimisation; see
    Note [Solving Wanted QCs from Given QCs].

(WFA2) Termination: see #19690.  We want to maintain the invariant (QC-INV):

    (QC-INV) Every quantified constraint returns a non-bottom dictionary

  just as every top-level instance declaration guarantees to return a non-bottom
  dictionary.  But as #19690 shows, it is possible to get a bottom dictionary
  by superclass selection if we aren't careful.  The situation is very similar
  to that described in Note [Recursive superclasses] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance;
  and we use the same solution:

  * Give the Givens a CtOrigin of (GivenOrigin (InstSkol IsQC head_size))
  * Give the Wanted a CtOrigin of (ScOrigin IsQC NakedSc)

  Both of these things are done in solveForAll.  Now the mechanism described
  in Note [Solving superclass constraints] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance takes over.

(WFA3) When inferring an appropriate context for a `deriving` instance, we
  really /do/ want to generate an implication, and perhaps leave it half-solved,
  from where we might then gather unsolved class constraints (via
  `approximateWC` called in GHC.Tc.Deriv.Infer.simplifyDeriv).  Rather than
  have a complicated special solver mode, we simply generate an /implication/
  in the first place, in GHC.Tc.Deriv.Utils.emitPredSpecConstraints.
  See Note [Inferred contexts from method constraints] in GHC.Tc.Deriv.Infer

Note [Solving a Given forall-constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a Given constraint
  [G] df :: forall ab. (Eq a, Ord b) => C x a b
we just add it to TcS's local InstEnv of known instances,
via addInertForAll.  Then, if we look up (C x Int Bool), say,
we'll find a match in the InstEnv.

Note [Solving Wanted QCs from Given QCs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we are about to solve a Wanted quantified constraint, and there is a
Given quantified constraint with the same type, we should directly solve the
Wanted from the Given (instead of building an implication).

Not only is this more direct and efficient, sometimes it is also /necessary/.
Consider:

  f :: forall a k. (Eq a, forall x. Eq x => Eq k x) => a -> blah
  {-# SPECIALISE (f :: forall k. (forall x. Eq x => Eq k x) => Int -> blah #-}

Here we specialise the `a` parameter to `f`, leaving the quantified constraint
untouched.  We want to get a rule like:

  RULE  forall @k (d :: forall x. Eq x => Eq k x).
            f @Int @k d = $sf @k d

But when we typecheck that expression-with-a-type-signature, if we don't solve
Wanted forall constraints directly, we will do so indirectly and end up with
this as the LHS of the RULE:

  (/\k \(df::forall x.Eq x => Eq k x). f @Int @k (/\x \(d:Eq x). df @x d))
     @kk dd

We run the simple optimiser on that, which eliminates the beta-redex. However,
it may not eta-reduce that `/\x \(d:Eq x)...`, because we are cautious about
eta-reduction. So we may be left with an over-complicated and hard-to-match
RULE LHS. It's all a bit silly, because the implication constraint is /identical/;
we just need to spot it.

This came up while implementing GHC proposal 493 (allowing expresions in
SPECIALISE pragmas).

{- Note [Rewriting with Refl]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the coercion is just reflexivity then you may re-use the same
evidence variable.  But be careful!  Although the coercion is Refl, new_pred
may reflect the result of unification alpha := ty, so new_pred might
not _look_ the same as old_pred, and it's vital to proceed from now on
using new_pred.

The rewriter preserves type synonyms, so they should appear in new_pred
as well as in old_pred; that is important for good error messages.

If we are rewriting with Refl, then there are no new rewriters to add to
the rewriter set. We check this with an assertion.
