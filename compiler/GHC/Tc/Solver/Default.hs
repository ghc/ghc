{- Note [Top-level Defaulting Plan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have considered two design choices for where/when to apply defaulting.
   (i) Do it in SimplCheck mode only /whenever/ you try to solve some
       simple constraints, maybe deep inside the context of implications.
       This used to be the case in GHC 7.4.1.
   (ii) Do it in a tight loop at simplifyTop, once all other constraints have
        finished. This is the current story.

Option (i) had many disadvantages:
   a) Firstly, it was deep inside the actual solver.
   b) Secondly, it was dependent on the context (Infer a type signature,
      or Check a type signature, or Interactive) since we did not want
      to always start defaulting when inferring (though there is an exception to
      this, see Note [Default while Inferring]).
   c) It plainly did not work. Consider typecheck/should_compile/DfltProb2.hs:
          f :: Int -> Bool
          f x = const True (\y -> let w :: a -> a
                                      w a = const a (y+1)
                                  in w y)
      We will get an implication constraint (for beta the type of y):
               [untch=beta] forall a. 0 => Num beta
      which we really cannot default /while solving/ the implication, since beta is
      untouchable.

Instead our new defaulting story is to pull defaulting out of the solver loop and
go with option (ii), implemented at SimplifyTop. Namely:
     - First, have a go at solving the residual constraint of the whole
       program
     - Try to approximate it with a simple constraint
     - Figure out derived defaulting equations for that simple constraint
     - Go round the loop again if you did manage to get some equations

Now, that has to do with class defaulting. However there exists type variable /kind/
defaulting. Again this is done at the top-level and the plan is:
     - At the top-level, once you had a go at solving the constraint, do
       figure out /all/ the touchable unification variables of the wanted constraints.
     - Apply defaulting to their kinds

More details in Note [DefaultTyVar].

Note [Limited defaulting in the ambiguity check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When simplifying constraints for the ambiguity check, we don't want full
defaulting.  E.g. #11947 was an example:
   f :: Num a => Int -> Int
This is ambiguous of course, but we don't want to default the (Num
alpha) constraint to (Num Int)!  Doing so gives a defaulting warning,
but no error.

But we still do

* tryConstraintDefaulting.  Example in T10009 where we have this type signature
    f :: (UnF (F b) ~ b) => F b -> ()
  We finish up with an equality that is a member of it's
    [W] hole{co_aF0} {rewriters: {co_aF0}}:: b_aES[tau:1] ~# b_aEP[sk:1]
  It is not unified because of (REWRITERS) in Note [Unification preconditions]
  in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify

  (`tryConstraintDefaulting` defaults call-stack and exception constraint
  as well as equalities; but in the case of the ambiguity check we will
  only see equality constraints.  Does not seem worth making a version
  of `tryConstraintDefaulting` that looks only for equalities.)

* tryUnsatisfiableGivens: see Wrinkle [Ambiguity] under point (C) of
  Note [Implementation of Unsatisfiable constraints] in GHC.Tc.Errors.

{- Note [Evidence terms from Unsatisfiable Givens]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An Unsatisfiable Given constraint, of the form [G] Unsatisfiable msg, should be
able to solve ANY Wanted constraint whatsoever.

Recall that we have

  unsatisfiable :: forall {rep} (msg :: ErrorMessage) (a :: TYPE rep)
                .  Unsatisfiable msg => a

We want to use this function, together with the evidence
[G] unsat_ev :: Unsatisfiable msg, to solve any other constraint [W] wtd_ty.

We could naively think that a valid evidence term for the Wanted might be:

  wanted_ev = unsatisfiable @{rep} @msg @wtd_ty unsat_ev

Unfortunately, this is a kind error: "wtd_ty :: CONSTRAINT rep", but
"unsatisfiable" expects the third type argument to be of kind "TYPE rep".

Instead, we use a boxing data constructor to box the constraint into a type.
In the end, we construct the following evidence for the implication:

  [G] unsat_ev :: Unsatisfiable msg
    ==>
      [W] wtd_ev :: wtd_ty

  wtd_ev =
    case unsatisfiable @{LiftedRep} @msg @(Dict ((##) -=> wtd_ty)) unsat_ev of
      MkDictBox ct -> ct (# #)

Note that we play the same trick with the function arrow -=> that we did
in order to define "unsatisfiable" in terms of "unsatisfiableLifted", as described
in Note [The Unsatisfiable representation-polymorphism trick] in base:GHC.TypeError.
This allows us to indirectly box constraints with different representations
(such as primitive equality constraints).

{- Note [When to do type-class defaulting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In GHC 7.6 and 7.8.2, we did type-class defaulting only if insolubleWC
was false, on the grounds that defaulting can't help solve insoluble
constraints.  But if we *don't* do defaulting we may report a whole
lot of errors that would be solved by defaulting; these errors are
quite spurious because fixing the single insoluble error means that
defaulting happens again, which makes all the other errors go away.
This is jolly confusing: #9033.

So it seems better to always do type-class defaulting.

However, always doing defaulting does mean that we'll do it in
situations like this (#5934):
   run :: (forall s. GenST s) -> Int
   run = fromInteger 0
We don't unify the return type of fromInteger with the given function
type, because the latter involves foralls.  So we're left with
    (Num alpha, alpha ~ (forall s. GenST s) -> Int)
Now we do defaulting, get alpha := Integer, and report that we can't
match Integer with (forall s. GenST s) -> Int.  That's not totally
stupid, but perhaps a little strange.

Another potential alternative would be to suppress *all* non-insoluble
errors if there are *any* insoluble errors, anywhere, but that seems
too drastic.

Note [Defaulting equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In top-level defaulting (as per Note [Top-level Defaulting Plan]), it makes
sense to try to default equality constraints, in addition to e.g. typeclass
defaulting: this doesn't threaten principal types (see DE1 below), but
allows GHC to accept strictly more programs.

This Note explains defaulting nominal equalities; see also
Note [Defaulting representational equalities] which describes
the defaulting of representational equalities.

Consider

  f :: forall a. (forall t. (F t ~ Int) => a -> Int) -> Int

  g :: Int
  g = f id

We'll typecheck

  id :: forall t. (F t ~ Int) => alpha[1] -> Int

where the `alpha[1]` comes from instantiating `f`. So we'll end up
with the implication constraint

   forall[2] t. (F t ~ Int) => alpha[1] ~ Int

and that can't be solved because `alpha` is untouchable under the
equality (F t ~ Int).

This is tiresome, and gave rise to user complaints: #25125 and #25029.
Moreover, in this case there is no good reason not to unify alpha:=Int.
Doing so solves the constraint, and since `alpha` is not otherwise
constrained, it does no harm.

In conclusion, for a Wanted equality constraint [W] lhs ~ rhs, if the only
reason for not unifying is that either lhs or rhs is an untouchable metavariable
then, in top-level defaulting, go ahead and unify.

In top-level defaulting, we already do several other somewhat-ad-hoc,
but terribly convenient, unifications. This is just one more.

Wrinkles:

(DE1) Note carefully that this does not threaten principal types.
  The original worry about unifying untouchable type variables was this:

     data T a where
       T1 :: T Bool
     f x = case x of T1 -> True

  Should we infer f :: T a -> Bool, or f :: T a -> a.  Both are valid, but
  neither is more general than the other.

(DE2) We still can't unify if there is a skolem-escape check, or an occurs check,
  or it it'd mean unifying a TyVarTv with a non-tyvar.  It's only the
  "untouchability test" that we lift.

(DE3) The contraint we are looking at may not be fully zonked; for example,
  an earlier defaulting might have affected it. So we zonk-on-the fly in
  `defaultEquality`.

(DE4) Promotion. Suppose we see  alpha[2] := Maybe beta[4].  We want to promote
  beta[4] to level 2 and unify alpha[2] := Maybe beta'[2].  This is done by
  checkTyEqRhs called in defaultEquality.

(DE5) Promotion. Suppose we see  alpha[2] := F beta[4], where F is a type
  family. Then we still want to promote beta to beta'[2], and unify. This is
  unusual: more commonly, we don't promote unification variables under a
  type family.  But here we want to.  (This mattered in #25251.)

  Hence the Bool flag on LC_Promote, and its use in `tef_unifying` in
  `defaultEquality`.

(DE6) /Don't/ unify if the RHS has a free coercion hole in it.  That means
  that there is an as-yet-unsolved equality constraint (whose evidence
  will fill that hole); unifying can lead to very confusing type errors.
  e.g.    [W] co1 :: IntRep ~ LiftedRep
          [W] co2 {rewritten by co1} :: alpha ~ t2 |> (TYPE co1)
  Unifying alpha := (t1 |> TYPE co1) is a Bad Idea.

  Note that we /do/ unify even if the constraint has a non-empty rewriter
  set, which has prevented unification up to now; see
  Note [Unify only if the rewriter set is empty] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.
  In obscure situations a constraint can end up in its own rewriter set, but
  without a coercion hole being in the RHS.

  See #10009, and Note [Limited defaulting in the ambiguity check].


Note [Must simplify after defaulting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We may have a deeply buried constraint
    (t:*) ~ (a:Open)
which we couldn't solve because of the kind incompatibility, and 'a' is free.
Then when we default 'a' we can solve the constraint.  And we want to do
that before starting in on type classes.  We MUST do it before reporting
errors, because it isn't an error!  #7967 was due to this.

Note [Defaulting representational equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we end up with [W] alpha ~#R Int, with no other constraints on alpha.
Then it makes sense to simply unify alpha := Int -- the alternative is to
reject the program due to an ambiguous metavariable alpha, so it makes sense
to unify and accept instead.

This is particularly convenient for users of `coerce`, as it lessens the
amount of type annotations required (see #21003). Consider for example:

  -- 'foldMap' defined using 'traverse'
  foldMapUsingTraverse :: forall t m a. (Traversable t, Monoid m) => (a -> m) -> t a -> m
  foldMapUsingTraverse = coerce $ traverse @t @(Const m)

  -- 'traverse_' defined using 'foldMap'
  traverse_UsingFoldMap :: forall f t a. (Foldable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f ()) -> t a -> f ()
  traverse_UsingFoldMap = coerce $ foldMap @t @(Ap f ())

Typechecking these functions results in unsolved Wanted constraints of the form
[W] alpha[tau] ~R# some_ty; accepting such programs by unifying
alpha := some_ty avoids the need for users to specify tiresome additional
type annotations, such as:

    foldMapUsingTraverse = coerce $ traverse @t @(Const m) @a
    traverse_UsingFoldMap = coerce $ foldMap @t @(Ap f ()) @a

Consider also the following example:

  -- 'sequence_', but for two nested 'Foldable' structures
  sequenceNested_ :: forall f1 f2. (Foldable f1, Foldable f2) => f1 (f2 (IO ())) -> IO ()
  sequenceNested_ = coerce $ sequence_ @( Compose f1 f2 )

Here, we end up with [W] mu[tau] beta[tau] ~#R IO (), and it similarly makes
sense to default mu := IO, beta := (). This avoids requiring the
user to provide additional type applications:

    sequenceNested_ = coerce $ sequence_ @( Compose f1 f2 ) @IO @()

The plan for defaulting a representational equality, say [W] ty1 ~R# ty2,
is thus as follows:

  1. attempt to unify ty1 ~# ty2 (at nominal role)
  2. a. if this succeeds without deferring any constraints, accept this solution
     b. otherwise, keep the original constraint.

(2b) ensures that we don't degrade all error messages by always turning unsolved
representational equalities into nominal ones; we only want to default a
representational equality when we can fully solve it.

Note that this does not threaten principle types. Recall that the original worry
(as per Note [Do not unify representational equalities]) was that we might have

    [W] alpha ~R# Int
    [W] alpha ~ Age

in which case unifying alpha := Int would be wrong, as the correct solution is
alpha := Age. This worry doesn't concern us in top-level defaulting, because
defaulting takes place after generalisation; it is fully monomorphic.

Note [How type-class constraints are defaulted]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type-class defaulting deals with the situation where we have unsolved
constraints like (Num alpha), where `alpha` is a unification variable.  We want
to pick a default for `alpha`, such as `alpha := Int` to resolve the ambiguity.

The function 'tryTypeClassDefaulting' implements type-class defaulting. The
algorithm for defaulting depends on whether certain extensions are enabled,
such as -XOverloadedStrings or -XExtendedDefaultRules. To explain this, let us
define the following:

  Unary typeclass:
    a typeclass with a single visible type argument.

    Examples:

      Num :: Type -> Constraint
      Eq :: Type -> Constraint
      Foldable :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint
      Typeable :: forall k. k -> Constraint   -- NB: also has an /invisible/ argument

    Non-examples:

      Nullary :: Constraint
      Binary :: Type -> Type -> Constraint
      Binary2 :: forall k -> k -> Constraint  -- Two visible arguments

  Defaultable class
    a typeclass which has at least one in-scope default declaration

    This includes the two different categories of default declarations:

      - Haskell 98 default declarations such as 'default (Integer, Float)'.

        - `Num` is always defaultable; either the user says 'default( Integer, Float )'
          or (absent such a declaration) the system fills in a fallback default declaration.
          See Section 4.3.4 in https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch4.html

        - With `OverloadedStrings`, the class `IsString` is defaultable
        - With `ExtendedDefaultRules`, the classes `Show`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Foldable` and `Traversable`
          are defaultable

      - Named default declarations, which apply to the named class, e.g.
        'default Cls(X, Y)' applies precisely to 'Cls'.
        Note that these may be locally defined, or they may be imported.

  Standard class:
    a class defined in the Prelude or the standard library, as defined
    by the Haskell 98 report (section 4.3.4)

    These are defined in GHC.Builtin.Names.standardClassKeys.

The rules for defaulting a collection 'S' of unsolved constraints are as follows:

  1. For each metavariable 'v' appearing in 'S', define

       U_v = { C v | C v ∈ U, C is a unary typeclass }

     We then process each 'U_v' in turn, in order to find a defaulting
     assignment 'v := ty' that solves all of 'U_v'.

  2. Unless -XExtendedDefaultRules is in effect, give up if 'v' appears:

      - in any constraint that isn't a unary class constraint
      - in a class constraint which is non-standard and does not have
        a default declaration in scope.

  3. Compute candidate assignments: for each unary typeclass 'C' in 'U_v' which
     has a default declaration in scope, find the first type 'ty' in the list
     of in-scope default types for 'C' for which all of 'U_v' is soluble.

  4. If there is precisely one type candidate type assignment 'ty' that allows
     all of 'U_v' to be solved, we default 'v := ty'. Otherwise, do nothing
     ('v' remains ambiguous).

Note [Defaulting plugins]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defaulting plugins enable extending or overriding the defaulting
behaviour. In `applyDefaultingRules`, before the built-in defaulting
mechanism runs, the loaded defaulting plugins are passed the
`WantedConstraints` and get a chance to propose defaulting assignments
based on them.

Proposals are represented as `[DefaultingProposal]` with each proposal
consisting of a type variable to fill-in, the list of defaulting types to
try in order, and a set of constraints to check at each try. This is
the same representation (albeit in a nicely packaged-up data type) as
the candidates generated by the built-in defaulting mechanism, so the
actual trying of proposals is done by the same `disambigGroup` function.

Wrinkle (DP1): The role of `WantedConstraints`

  Plugins are passed `WantedConstraints` that can perhaps be
  progressed on by defaulting. But a defaulting plugin is not a solver
  plugin, its job is to provide defaulting proposals, i.e. mappings of
  type variable to types. How do plugins know which type variables
  they are supposed to default?

  The `WantedConstraints` passed to the defaulting plugin are zonked
  beforehand to ensure all remaining metavariables are unfilled. Thus,
  the `WantedConstraints` serve a dual purpose: they are both the
  constraints of the given context that can act as hints to the
  defaulting, as well as the containers of the type variables under
  consideration for defaulting.

Wrinkle (DP2): Interactions between defaulting mechanisms

  In the general case, we have multiple defaulting plugins loaded and
  there is also the built-in defaulting mechanism. In this case, we
  have to be careful to keep the `WantedConstraints` passed to the
  plugins up-to-date by zonking between successful defaulting
  rounds. Otherwise, two plugins might come up with a defaulting
  proposal for the same metavariable; if the first one is accepted by
  `disambigGroup` (thus the meta gets filled), the second proposal
  becomes invalid (see #23821 for an example).

Note [Defaulting insolubles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a set of wanteds is insoluble, we have no hope of accepting the
program. Yet we do not stop constraint solving, etc., because we may
simplify the wanteds to produce better error messages. So, once
we have an insoluble constraint, everything we do is just about producing
helpful error messages.

Should we default in this case or not? Let's look at an example (tcfail004):

  (f,g) = (1,2,3)

With defaulting, we get a conflict between (a0,b0) and (Integer,Integer,Integer).
Without defaulting, we get a conflict between (a0,b0) and (a1,b1,c1). I (Richard)
find the latter more helpful. Several other test cases (e.g. tcfail005) suggest
similarly. So: we should not do class defaulting with insolubles.

On the other hand, RuntimeRep-defaulting is different. Witness tcfail078:

  f :: Integer i => i
  f =               0

Without RuntimeRep-defaulting, we GHC suggests that Integer should have kind
TYPE r0 -> Constraint and then complains that r0 is actually untouchable
(presumably, because it can't be sure if `Integer i` entails an equality).
If we default, we are told of a clash between (* -> Constraint) and Constraint.
The latter seems far better, suggesting we *should* do RuntimeRep-defaulting
even on insolubles.

But, evidently, not always. Witness UnliftedNewtypesInfinite:

  newtype Foo = FooC (# Int#, Foo #)

This should fail with an occurs-check error on the kind of Foo (with -XUnliftedNewtypes).
If we default RuntimeRep-vars, we get

  Expecting a lifted type, but ‘(# Int#, Foo #)’ is unlifted

which is just plain wrong.

Another situation in which we don't want to default involves concrete metavariables.

In equalities such as   alpha[conc] ~# rr[sk]  ,  alpha[conc] ~# RR beta[tau]
for a type family RR (all at kind RuntimeRep), we would prefer to report a
representation-polymorphism error rather than default alpha and get error:

  Could not unify `rr` with `Lifted` / Could not unify `RR b0` with `Lifted`

which is very confusing. For this reason, we weed out the concrete
metavariables participating in such equalities in nonDefaultableTyVarsOfWC.
Just looking at insolublity is not enough, as `alpha[conc] ~# RR beta[tau]` could
become soluble after defaulting beta (see also #21430).

Conclusion: we should do RuntimeRep-defaulting on insolubles only when the
user does not want to hear about RuntimeRep stuff -- that is, when
-fprint-explicit-runtime-reps is not set.
However, we must still take care not to default concrete type variables
participating in an equality with a non-concrete type, as seen in the
last example above.

Note [Avoiding spurious errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When doing the unification for defaulting, we check for skolem
type variables, and simply don't default them.  For example:
   f = (*)      -- Monomorphic
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g x = f x x
Here, we get a complaint when checking the type signature for g,
that g isn't polymorphic enough; but then we get another one when
dealing with the (Num a) context arising from f's definition;
we try to unify a with Int (to default it), but find that it's
already been unified with the rigid variable from g's type sig.

Note [Multi-parameter defaults]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With -XExtendedDefaultRules, we default only based on single-variable
constraints, but do not exclude from defaulting any type variables which also
appear in multi-variable constraints. This means that the following will
default properly:

   default (Integer, Double)

   class A b (c :: Symbol) where
      a :: b -> Proxy c

   instance A Integer c where a _ = Proxy

   main = print (a 5 :: Proxy "5")

Note that if we change the above instance ("instance A Integer") to
"instance A Double", we get an error:

   No instance for (A Integer "5")

This is because the first defaulted type (Integer) has successfully satisfied
its single-parameter constraints (in this case Num).
