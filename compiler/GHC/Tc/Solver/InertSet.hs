Note [WorkList priorities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A WorkList contains canonical and non-canonical items (of all flavours).
Notice that each Ct now has a simplification depth. We may
consider using this depth for prioritization as well in the future.

As a simple form of priority queue, our worklist separates out

* equalities (wl_eqs); see Note [Prioritise equalities]
* all the rest (wl_rest)

Note [Prioritise equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's very important to process equalities over class constraints:

* (Efficiency)  The general reason to do so is that if we process a
  class constraint first, we may end up putting it into the inert set
  and then kicking it out later.  That's extra work compared to just
  doing the equality first.

* (Avoiding fundep iteration) As #14723 showed, it's possible to
  get non-termination if we
      - Emit the fundep equalities for a class constraint,
        generating some fresh unification variables.
      - That leads to some unification
      - Which kicks out the class constraint
      - Which isn't solved (because there are still some more
        equalities in the work-list), but generates yet more fundeps
  Solution: prioritise equalities over class constraints

* (Class equalities) We need to prioritise equalities even if they
  are hidden inside a class constraint; see Note [Prioritise class equalities]

* (Kick-out) We want to apply this priority scheme to kicked-out
  constraints too (see the call to extendWorkListCt in kick_out_rewritable)
  E.g. a CIrredCan can be a hetero-kinded (t1 ~ t2), which may become
  homo-kinded when kicked out, and hence we want to prioritise it.

Further refinements:

* Among the equalities we prioritise ones with an empty rewriter set;
  see Note [Wanteds rewrite Wanteds] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint, wrinkle (W1).

* Among equalities with an empty rewriter set, we prioritise nominal equalities.
   * They have more rewriting power, so doing them first is better.
   * Prioritising them ameliorates the incompleteness of newtype
     solving: see (Ex2) in Note [Decomposing newtype equalities] in
     GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.

Note [Prioritise class equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We prioritise equalities in the solver (see selectWorkItem). But class
constraints like (a ~ b) and (a ~~ b) are actually equalities too;
see Note [The equality types story] in GHC.Builtin.Types.Prim.

Failing to prioritise these is inefficient (more kick-outs etc).
But, worse, it can prevent us spotting a "recursive knot" among
Wanted constraints.  See comment:10 of #12734 for a worked-out
example.

So we arrange to put these particular class constraints in the wl_eqs.

  NB: since we do not currently apply the substitution to the
  inert_solved_dicts, the knot-tying still seems a bit fragile.
  But this makes it better.

Note [Residual implications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The wl_implics in the WorkList are the residual implication
constraints that are generated while solving or canonicalising the
current worklist.  Specifically, when canonicalising
   (forall a. t1 ~ forall a. t2)
from which we get the implication
   (forall a. t1 ~ t2)

{- Note [Solved dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we apply a top-level instance declaration, we add the "solved"
dictionary to the inert_solved_dicts.  In general, we use it to avoid
creating a new EvVar when we have a new goal that we have solved in
the past.

But in particular, we can use it to create *recursive* dictionaries.
The simplest, degenerate case is
    instance C [a] => C [a] where ...
If we have
    [W] d1 :: C [x]
then we can apply the instance to get
    d1 = $dfCList d
    [W] d2 :: C [x]
Now 'd1' goes in inert_solved_dicts, and we can solve d2 directly from d1.
    d1 = $dfCList d
    d2 = d1

See Note [Example of recursive dictionaries]

VERY IMPORTANT INVARIANT:

 (Solved Dictionary Invariant)
    Every member of the inert_solved_dicts is the result
    of applying an instance declaration that "takes a step"

    An instance "takes a step" if it has the form
        dfunDList d1 d2 = MkD (...) (...) (...)
    That is, the dfun is lazy in its arguments, and guarantees to
    immediately return a dictionary constructor.  NB: all dictionary
    data constructors are lazy in their arguments.

    This property is crucial to ensure that all dictionaries are
    non-bottom, which in turn ensures that the whole "recursive
    dictionary" idea works at all, even if we get something like
        rec { d = dfunDList d dx }
    See Note [Recursive superclasses] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance.

 Reason:
   - All instances, except two exceptions listed below, "take a step"
     in the above sense

   - Exception 1: local quantified constraints have no such guarantee;
     indeed, adding a "solved dictionary" when applying a quantified
     constraint led to the ability to define unsafeCoerce
     in #17267.

   - Exception 2: the magic built-in instance for (~) has no
     such guarantee.  It behaves as if we had
         class    (a ~# b) => (a ~ b) where {}
         instance (a ~# b) => (a ~ b) where {}
     The "dfun" for the instance is strict in the coercion.
     Anyway there's no point in recording a "solved dict" for
     (t1 ~ t2); it's not going to allow a recursive dictionary
     to be constructed.  Ditto (~~) and Coercible.

THEREFORE we only add a "solved dictionary"
  - when applying an instance declaration
  - subject to Exceptions 1 and 2 above

In implementation terms
  - GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.addSolvedDict adds a new solved dictionary,
    conditional on the kind of instance

  - It is only called when applying an instance decl,
    in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict.tryInstances

  - ClsInst.InstanceWhat says what kind of instance was
    used to solve the constraint.  In particular
      * LocalInstance identifies quantified constraints
      * BuiltinEqInstance identifies the strange built-in
        instances for equality.

  - ClsInst.instanceReturnsDictCon says which kind of
    instance guarantees to return a dictionary constructor

Other notes about solved dictionaries

* See also Note [Do not add superclasses of solved dictionaries]

* The inert_solved_dicts field is not rewritten by equalities,
  so it may get out of date.

* The inert_solved_dicts are all Wanteds, never givens

* We only cache dictionaries from top-level instances, not from
  local quantified constraints.  Reason: if we cached the latter
  we'd need to purge the cache when bringing new quantified
  constraints into scope, because quantified constraints "shadow"
  top-level instances.

Note [Do not add superclasses of solved dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every member of inert_solved_dicts is the result of applying a
dictionary function, NOT of applying superclass selection to anything.
Consider

        class Ord a => C a where
        instance Ord [a] => C [a] where ...

Suppose we are trying to solve
  [G] d1 : Ord a
  [W] d2 : C [a]

Then we'll use the instance decl to give

  [G] d1 : Ord a     Solved: d2 : C [a] = $dfCList d3
  [W] d3 : Ord [a]

We must not add d4 : Ord [a] to the 'solved' set (by taking the
superclass of d2), otherwise we'll use it to solve d3, without ever
using d1, which would be a catastrophe.

Solution: when extending the solved dictionaries, do not add superclasses.
That's why each element of the inert_solved_dicts is the result of applying
a dictionary function.

Note [Example of recursive dictionaries]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--- Example 1

    data D r = ZeroD | SuccD (r (D r));

    instance (Eq (r (D r))) => Eq (D r) where
        ZeroD     == ZeroD     = True
        (SuccD a) == (SuccD b) = a == b
        _         == _         = False;

    equalDC :: D [] -> D [] -> Bool;
    equalDC = (==);

We need to prove (Eq (D [])). Here's how we go:

   [W] d1 : Eq (D [])
By instance decl of Eq (D r):
   [W] d2 : Eq [D []]      where   d1 = dfEqD d2
By instance decl of Eq [a]:
   [W] d3 : Eq (D [])      where   d2 = dfEqList d3
                                   d1 = dfEqD d2
Now this wanted can interact with our "solved" d1 to get:
    d3 = d1

    instance Foo t => Sat (Maybe t)                             -- dfunSat

    instance Data Maybe a => Foo a                              -- dfunFoo1
    instance Foo a        => Foo [a]                            -- dfunFoo2
    instance                 Foo [Char]                         -- dfunFoo3

Consider generating the superclasses of the instance declaration
         instance Foo a => Foo [a]

So our problem is this
    [G] d0 : Foo t
    [W] d1 : Data Maybe [t]   -- Desired superclass

We may add the given in the inert set, along with its superclasses
  Inert:
    [G] d0 : Foo t
    [G] d01 : Data Maybe t   -- Superclass of d0
  WorkList
    [W] d1 : Data Maybe [t]

Solve d1 using instance dfunData2; d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3
  Inert:
    [G] d0 : Foo t
    [G] d01 : Data Maybe t   -- Superclass of d0
  Solved:
        d1 : Data Maybe [t]
  WorkList:
    [W] d2 : Sat (Maybe [t])
    [W] d3 : Data Maybe t

Now, we may simplify d2 using dfunSat; d2 := dfunSat d4
  Inert:
    [G] d0 : Foo t
    [G] d01 : Data Maybe t   -- Superclass of d0
  Solved:
        d1 : Data Maybe [t]
        d2 : Sat (Maybe [t])
  WorkList:
    [W] d3 : Data Maybe t
    [W] d4 : Foo [t]

Now, we can just solve d3 from d01; d3 := d01
  Inert
    [G] d0 : Foo t
    [G] d01 : Data Maybe t   -- Superclass of d0
  Solved:
        d1 : Data Maybe [t]
        d2 : Sat (Maybe [t])
  WorkList
    [W] d4 : Foo [t]

Now, solve d4 using dfunFoo2;  d4 := dfunFoo2 d5
  Inert
    [G] d0  : Foo t
    [G] d01 : Data Maybe t   -- Superclass of d0
  Solved:
        d1 : Data Maybe [t]
        d2 : Sat (Maybe [t])
        d4 : Foo [t]
  WorkList:
    [W] d5 : Foo t

Now, d5 can be solved! d5 := d0

Result
   d1 := dfunData2 d2 d3
   d2 := dfunSat d4
   d3 := d01
   d4 := dfunFoo2 d5
   d5 := d0

{- Note [Tracking Given equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For reasons described in (UNTOUCHABLE) in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify
Note [Unification preconditions], we can't unify
   alpha[2] ~ Int
under a level-4 implication if there are any Given equalities
bound by the implications at level 3 of 4.  To that end, the
InertCans tracks

  inert_given_eq_lvl :: TcLevel
     -- The TcLevel of the innermost implication that has a Given
     -- equality of the sort that make a unification variable untouchable
     -- (see Note [Unification preconditions] in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify).

We update inert_given_eq_lvl whenever we add a Given to the
inert set, in updGivenEqs.

Then a unification variable alpha[n] is untouchable iff
    n < inert_given_eq_lvl
that is, if the unification variable was born outside an
enclosing Given equality.

Exactly which constraints should trigger (UNTOUCHABLE), and hence
should update inert_given_eq_lvl?

(TGE1) We do /not/ need to worry about let-bound skolems, such as
     forall[2] a. a ~ [b] => blah
  See Note [Let-bound skolems] and the isOuterTyVar tests in `updGivenEqs`

(TGE2) However, solely to support better error messages (see Note [HasGivenEqs] in
   GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint) we also track these "local" equalities in the
   boolean inert_given_eqs field.  This field is used only subsequntly (see
   `getHasGivenEqs`), to set the ic_given_eqs field to LocalGivenEqs.

(TGE3) Consider an implication
      forall[2]. beta[1] => alpha[1] ~ Int
  where beta is a unification variable that has already been unified
  to () in an outer scope.  Then alpha[1] is perfectly touchable and
  we can unify alpha := Int. So when deciding whether the givens contain
  an equality, we should canonicalise first, rather than just looking at
  the /original/ givens (#8644).

(TGE4) However, we must take account of *potential* equalities. Consider the
   same example again, but this time we have /not/ yet unified beta:
      forall[2] beta[1] => ...blah...

   Because beta might turn into an equality, updGivenEqs conservatively
   treats it as a potential equality, and updates inert_give_eq_lvl

(TGE5) We should not look at the equality relation involved (nominal vs
   representational), because representational equalities can still
   imply nominal ones. For example, if (G a ~R G b) and G's argument's
   role is nominal, then we can deduce a ~N b.

Historical note: prior to #24938 we also ignored Given equalities that
did not mention an "outer" type variable.  But that is wrong, as #24938
showed. Another example is immortalised in test LocalGivenEqs2
   data T where
      MkT :: F a ~ G b => a -> b -> T
   f (MkT _ _) = True
We should not infer the type for `f`; let-bound-skolems does not apply.

Note [Let-bound skolems]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If   * the inert set contains a canonical Given CEqCan (a ~ ty)
and  * 'a' is a skolem bound in this very implication,

then:
   a) The Given is pretty much a let-binding, like
         f :: (a ~ b->c) => a -> a
      Here the equality constraint is like saying
         let a = b->c in ...
      It is not adding any new, local equality  information,
      and hence can be ignored by has_given_eqs

   b) 'a' will have been completely substituted out in the inert set,
      so we can safely discard it.

For an example, see #9211.

The actual test is in `isLetBoundSkolemCt`

Wrinkles:

(LBS1) See GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify Note [Deeper level on the left] for how we ensure
       that the correct variable is on the left of the equality when both are
       tyvars.

(LBS2) We also want this to work for
            forall a. [G] F b ~ a   (CEqCt with TyFamLHS)
   Here the Given will have a TyFamLHS, with the skolem-bound tyvar on the RHS.
   See tests T24938a, and LocalGivenEqs.

(LBS3) Happily (LBS2) also makes cycle-breakers work. Suppose we have
            forall a. [G] (F a) Int ~ a
  where F has arity 1, and `a` is the locally-bound skolem.  Then, as
  Note [Type equality cycles] explains, we split into
           [G] F a ~ cbv, [G] cbv Int ~ a
  where `cbv` is the cycle breaker variable.  But cbv has the same level
  as `a`, so `isOuterTyVar` (called in `isLetBoundSkolemCt`) will return False.

  This actually matters occasionally: see test LocalGivenEqs.

You might wonder whether the skolem really needs to be bound "in the
very same implication" as the equality constraint.
Consider this (c.f. #15009):

  data S a where
    MkS :: (a ~ Int) => S a

  g :: forall a. S a -> a -> blah
  g x y = let h = \z. ( z :: Int
                      , case x of
                           MkS -> [y,z])
          in ...

From the type signature for `g`, we get `y::a` .  Then when we
encounter the `\z`, we'll assign `z :: alpha[1]`, say.  Next, from the
body of the lambda we'll get

  [W] alpha[1] ~ Int                             -- From z::Int
  [W] forall[2]. (a ~ Int) => [W] alpha[1] ~ a   -- From [y,z]

Now, unify alpha := a.  Now we are stuck with an unsolved alpha~Int!
So we must treat alpha as untouchable under the forall[2] implication.

Possible future improvements.  The current test just looks to see whether one
side of an equality is a locally-bound skolem.  But actually we could, in
theory, do better: if one side (or both sides, actually) of an equality
ineluctably mentions a local skolem, then the equality cannot possibly impact
types outside of the implication (because doing to would cause those types to be
ill-scoped). The problem is the "ineluctably": this means that no expansion,
other solving, etc., could possibly get rid of the variable. This is hard,
perhaps impossible, to know for sure, especially when we think about type family
interactions. (And it's a user-visible property so we don't want it to be hard
to predict.) So we keep the existing check, looking for one lone variable,
because we're sure that variable isn't going anywhere.

Note [Detailed InertCans Invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The InertCans represents a collection of constraints with the following properties:

  * All canonical

  * No two dictionaries with the same head
  * No two CIrreds with the same type

  * Family equations inert wrt top-level family axioms

  * Dictionaries have no matching top-level instance

  * Given family or dictionary constraints don't mention touchable
    unification variables

  * Non-CEqCan constraints are fully rewritten with respect
    to the CEqCan equalities (modulo eqCanRewrite of course;
    eg a wanted cannot rewrite a given)

  * CEqCan equalities: see Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities]
    Also see documentation in Constraint.Ct for a list of invariants

Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our main invariant:
   the EqCts in inert_eqs should be a
        terminating generalised substitution

-------------- Definition [Can-rewrite relation] --------------
A "can-rewrite" relation between flavours, written f1 >= f2, is a
binary relation with the following properties

  (R1) >= is transitive
  (R2) If f1 >= f, and f2 >= f,
       then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1
  (See Note [Why R2?].)

Lemma (L0). If f1 >= f then f1 >= f1
Proof.      By property (R2), with f1=f2

--------- Definition [Generalised substitution] ---------------
A "generalised substitution" S is a set of triples (lhs -f-> t), where
  - lhs is a type variable or an exactly-saturated type family application
                  (that is, lhs is a CanEqLHS)
  - t is a type
  - f is a flavour

such that

  (WF1) if (lhs1 -f1-> t1) in S
           (lhs2 -f2-> t2) in S
        then (f1 >= f2) implies that lhs1 does not appear within lhs2

  (WF2) if (lhs -f-> t) is in S, then t /= lhs

  (WF3) No LHS in S is rewritable in an RHS in S,
        in the argument of a type family application (F ty1..tyn)
        where F heads a LHS in S

--------- Definition [Applying a generalised substitution] ----------
If S is a generalised substitution
   S(f,lhs)      = rhs,             if (lhs -fs-> rhs) in S, and fs >= f
   S(f,T t1..tn) = T S(f1,t1)..S(fn,tn)
   S(f,t1 t2)    = S(f,t1) S(f_N,t2)
   S(f,t)        = t
Here f1..fn are obtained from f and T using the roles of T, and f_N is
the nominal version of f.  See Note [Flavours with roles].

Notation: repeated application.
  S^0(f,t)     = t
  S^(n+1)(f,t) = S(f, S^n(t))
  S*(f,t) is the result of applying S until you reach a fixpoint

---------  Definition [Terminating generalised substitution] ---------
A generalised substitution S is *terminating* iff

  (IG1) for every f,t, there is an n such that
             S^n(f,t) = S^(n+1)(f,t)

By (IG1) we define S*(f,t) to be the result of exahaustively
applying S(f,_) to t.
--------- End of definitions ------------------------------------


Rationale for (WF1)-(WF3)
-------------------------
* (WF1) guarantees that S is well-defined /as a function/;
  see Theorem (S is a function)

   Theorem (S is a function): S(f,t0) is well defined as a function.
   Proof: Suppose (lhs -f1-> t1) and (lhs -f2-> t2) are both in S,
               and  f1 >= f and f2 >= f
          Then by (R2) f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1, which contradicts (WF1)
   Note: this argument isn't quite right.  WF1 ensures that lhs1 does
   not appear inside lhs2, and that guarantees confluence. But I can't quite
   see how to make that argument precise.

* (WF2) is a bit trivial.  It means that if S is terminating, so that
  S^(n+1)(f,t) = S^n(f,t), then there is no LHS of S in S^n(f,t).  We
  never get a silly infinite sequence a -> a -> a -> a  .... which is
  technically a fixed point but would still go on for ever.

* (WF3) is need for the termination proof.

Note that termination is not the same as idempotence.  To apply S to a
type, you may have to apply it recursively.  But termination does
guarantee that this recursive use will terminate.

Note [Why R2?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
R2 states that, if we have f1 >= f and f2 >= f, then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >=
f1. If we do not have R2, we will easily fall into a loop.

To see why, imagine we have f1 >= f, f2 >= f, and that's it. Then, let our
inert set S = {a -f1-> b, b -f2-> a}. Computing S(f,a) does not terminate. And
yet, we have a hard time noticing an occurs-check problem when building S, as
the two equalities cannot rewrite one another.

R2 actually restricts our ability to accept user-written programs. See
Note [Avoiding rewriting cycles] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint for an example.

Note [Rewritable]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Definition. A CanEqLHS lhs is *rewritable* in a type t if the
lhs tree appears as a subtree within t without traversing any of the following
components of t:
  * coercions (whether they appear in casts CastTy or as arguments CoercionTy)
  * kinds of variable occurrences
The check for rewritability *does* look in kinds of the bound variable of a
ForAllTy.

The reason for this definition is that the rewriter does not rewrite in coercions
or variables' kinds. In turn, the rewriter does not need to rewrite there because
those places are never used for controlling the behaviour of the solver: these
places are not used in matching instances or in decomposing equalities.

This definition is used by the anyRewritableXXX family of functions and is meant
to model the actual behaviour in GHC.Tc.Solver.Rewrite.

Goal: If lhs is not rewritable in t, then t is a fixpoint of the generalised
substitution containing only {lhs -f*-> t'}, where f* is a flavour such that f* >= f
for all f.

Wrinkles

* Taking roles into account: we must consider a rewrite at a given role. That is,
  a rewrite arises from some equality, and that equality has a role associated
  with it. As we traverse a type, we track what role we are allowed to rewrite with.

  For example, suppose we have an inert [G] b ~R# Int. Then b is rewritable in
  Maybe b but not in F b, where F is a type function. This role-aware logic is
  present in both the anyRewritableXXX functions and in the rewriter.
  See also Note [anyRewritableTyVar must be role-aware] in GHC.Tc.Utils.TcType.

* There is one exception to the claim that non-rewritable parts of the tree do
  not affect the solver: we sometimes do an occurs-check to decide e.g. how to
  orient an equality. (See the comments on GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.canEqTyVarFunEq.)
  Accordingly, the presence of a variable in a kind or coercion just might
  influence the solver. Here is an example:

    type family Const x y where
      Const x y = x

    AxConst :: forall x y. Const x y ~# x

    alpha :: Const Type Nat
    [W] alpha ~ Int |> (sym (AxConst Type alpha) ;;
                        AxConst Type alpha ;;
                        sym (AxConst Type Nat))

  The cast is clearly ludicrous (it ties together a cast and its symmetric
  version), but we can't quite rule it out. (See (EQ1) from Note [Respecting
  definitional equality] in GHC.Core.TyCo.Rep to see why we need the Const Type
  Nat bit.) And yet this cast will (quite rightly) prevent alpha from unifying
  with the RHS. I (Richard E) don't have an example of where this problem can
  arise from a Haskell program, but we don't have an air-tight argument for why
  the definition of *rewritable* given here is correct.

Note [Extending the inert equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Main Theorem [Stability under extension]
   GIVEN a "work item" [lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w]
         and a terminating generalised substitution S,

   SUCH THAT
      (T1) S(fw,lhs_w) = lhs_w   -- LHS of work-item is a fixpoint of S(fw,_)
      (T2) S(fw,rhs_w) = rhs_w   -- RHS of work-item is a fixpoint of S(fw,_)
      (T3) lhs_w not in rhs_w    -- No occurs check in the work item
             -- If lhs is a type family application, we require only that
             -- lhs is not *rewritable* in rhs_w. See Note [Rewritable] and
             -- Note [EqCt occurs check] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint.
      (T4) no [lhs_s -fs-> rhs_s] in S meets [The KickOut Criteria]
           (i.e. we already kicked any such items out!)

   THEN the extended substitution T = S+(lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w)
        is a terminating generalised substitution

How do we establish these conditions?

  * (T1) and (T2) are guaranteed by exhaustively rewriting the work-item
    with S(fw,_).

  * (T3) is guaranteed by an occurs-check on the work item.
    This is done during canonicalisation, in checkTypeEq; invariant
    (TyEq:OC) of CEqCan. See also Note [EqCt occurs check] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint.

  * (T4) is established by GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.kickOutRewritable.  If the inert
    set contains a triple that meets the KickOut Criteria, we kick it out and
    add it to the work list for later re-examination.  See
    Note [The KickOut Criteria]

Theorem: T (defined in "THEN" above) is a generalised substitution;
  that is, it satisfies (WF1)-(WF3)
Proof:
  (WF1) Suppose we are adding [lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w], and [lhs_s -fs-> rhs_s] is in S.
        Then:
          - by (T1)  if fs>=fw, lhs_s does not occur within lhs_w.
          - by (KK1) if fw>=fs, lhs_w is not rewritable in lhs_s, or we'd have
            kicked out the stable constraint.

  (WF2) is directly guaranteed by (T3)

  (WF3) No lhs_s in S is rewritable in rhs_w at all, because of (T2)
        And (KK2) guarantees that lhs_w is not rewritable under a type
        family in rhs_s

Note [The KickOut Criteria]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kicking out is a Bad Thing:
* It means we have to re-process a constraint.  The less we kick out, the better.
* In the limit, kicking can lead to non-termination: imagine that we /always/
  kick out the entire inert set!
* Because (mid 2024) we don't support sharing in constraints, excessive kicking out
  can lead to exponentially big constraints (#24984).

So we seek to do as little kicking out as possible.  For example, consider this,
which happens a lot:

   Inert:  g1: a ~ Maybe b
   Work:   g2: b ~ Int

We do /not/ kick out g1 when adding g2.  The new substitution S' = {g1,g2} is still
/terminating/ but it is not /idmempotent/.  To apply S' to, say, (Tree a), we may
need to apply it twice:  Tree a --> Tree (Maybe b) --> Tree (Maybe Int)

Here are the KickOut Criteria:

    When adding [lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w] to a well-formed terminating substitution S,
    element [lhs_s -fs-> rhs_s] in S meets the KickOut Criteria if:

    (KK0) fw >= fs    AND   any of (KK1), (KK2) or (KK3) hold

    * (KK1: satisfy WF1) `lhs_w` is rewritable in `lhs_s`.

    * (KK2: termination) `lhs_w` is rewritable in `rhs_s` in these positions:
        If not(fs>=fw)
        then (KK2a) anywhere
        else (KK2b) look only in the argument of type family applications,
                    whose type family heads some LHS in `S`

    * (KK3: completeness)
      If not(fs >= fw)   -- If fs can rewrite fw, kick-out is redundant/harmful
      * (KK3a) If the role of `fs` is Nominal:
           kick out if `rhs_s = lhs_w`
      * (KK3b) If the role of `fs` is Representational:
           kick out if `rhs_s` is of form `(lhs_w t1 .. tn)`

Rationale

* (KK0) kick out only if `fw` can rewrite `fs`.
  Reason: suppose we kick out (lhs1 -fs-> s), and add (lhs -fw-> t) to the ineart
  set. The latter can't rewrite the former, so the kick-out achieved nothing

* (KK1) `lhs_w` is rewritable in `lhs_s`.
  Reason: needed to guarantee (WF1).  See Theorem: T is well formed

* (KK2) see Note [KK2: termination of the extended substitution]

* (KK3) see Note [KK3: completeness of solving]

The above story is a bit vague wrt roles, but the code is not.
See Note [Flavours with roles]

Note [KK2: termination of the extended substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proving termination of the extended substitution T is surprisingly tricky.

* Reason for (KK2a).  Consider
      Work:  [G] b ~ a
      Inert: [W] a ~ b
  If we don't kick out the inert, then we get a loop on e.g. [W] a ~ Int.
  But if both were Wanted we really should not kick out (the substitution does not
  have to be idempotent). So we only look everywhere for the `lhs_w` if
  not (fs>=fw), that is the inert item cannot rewrite the work item.  So in the
  above example we will kick out; but if both were Wanted we won't.

* Reason for (KK2b).  Consider the case where (fs >= fw)
      Work:  [G] a ~ Int
      Inert: [G] F Int ~ F a
  If we just added the work item, the substitution would loop on type (F Int).
  So we must kick out the inert item, even though (fs>=fw). (KK2b) does this
  by looking for lhs_w under type family applications in rhs_s.

  (KK2b) makes kick-out less aggressive by looking only under type-family applications,
  in the case where (fs >= fw), and that made a /huge/ difference to #24944.

Tricky examples in: #19042, #17672, #24984. The last (#24984) is particular subtle:

  Inert:   [W] g1: F a0 ~ F a1
           [W] g2: F a2 ~ F a1
           [W] g3: F a3 ~ F a1

Now we add [W] g4: F a1 ~ F a7.  Should we kick out g1,g2,g3?  No!  The
substitution doesn't need to be idempotent, merely terminating.  And in #24984
it turned out that we kept adding one new constraint and kicking out all the
previous inert ones (and that rewriting led to exponentially big constraints due
to lack of contraint sharing.)  So we only want to look /under/ type family applications.

The proof is hard. We start by ignoring flavours. Suppose that:
* We are adding [lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w] to a well-formed, terminating substitution S.
* None of the constraints in S meet the KickOut Criteria.
* Define T = S+[lhs_w -fw-> rhs_w]
* `f` is an arbitrary flavour

Lemma 1: for any lhs_s in S, T*(f,lhs_s) terminates.
  Proof.
  * We know that r1 = S*(f,lhs_s) terminates.
  * Moreover, we know there are no occurrences of lhs_w under a type family (which
    is the head of a LHS) in r1 (KK2)+(WF3).  We need (WF3) because you might wonder
    what if rhs_s is (F a), and [a --> lhs_w] was in S.  But (WF3) prevents that.
  * Define r2 = r1{rhs_w/lhs_w}.  We know that rhs_w has no occurrences of any lhs in S,
    nor of lhs_w.
  * Since any occurrence of lhs_w does not occur under a type family, the substitution
    won't make any F t1..tn ~ s in S match.
  * So r2 is a fixed point of T.

Lemma 2: T*(f,lhs_w) teminates.
  Proof: no occurrences of any LHS in rhs_w.

Theorem. For any type r, T*(r) terminates.
  Proof:
  1. Consider any sub-term of r, which is a LHS of T.
     - Rewrite it with T*; this terminates (Lemma 1).
     - Do this simultaneously to all sub-terms that match a LHS of T, yielding r1.
  2. Could this new r1 have a sub-term that is an LHS of T?  Yes, but only if r has a
     sub-term F w, and w rewrote in Step 1 to w' and F w' matches a LHS in T.
  3. Very well: apply step 1 again, but note that /doing so consumes one of the family
     applications in the original r/.
  4. After Step 1 either we have reached a fixed point, or we repeat Step 1 consuming at
     least one family application of r.
  5. There are only a finite number of family applications in r, so this process terminates.

Example:

Inert set:   gs : F Int ~ b
Work item:   gw : b ~ Int

F (F (F b)) --[gw]--> F (F (F Int)) --[gs]--> F (F b)
            --[gw]--> F (F Int)     --[gs]--> F b
            --[gw]--> F Int         --[gs]--> b
            --[gw]--> Int

Notice that each iteration of Step 1 strips off one of the layers of F, all
of which were in the original r.

The argument is even more tricky when flavours are involved, and we have not
fleshed it out in detail.

Note [KK3: completeness of solving]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(KK3) is not necessary for the extended substitution
to be terminating.  In fact (KK0) could be made stronger by saying
   ... then (not (fw >= fs) or not (fs >= fs))
But it's not enough for S to be /terminating/; we also want /completeness/.
That is, we want to be able to solve all soluble wanted equalities.
Suppose we have
   work-item   b -G-> a
   inert-item  a -W-> b
Assuming (G >= W) but not (W >= W), this fulfills all the conditions,
so we could extend the inerts, thus:
   inert-items   b -G-> a
                 a -W-> b
But if we kicked-out the inert item, we'd get
   work-item     a -W-> b
   inert-item    b -G-> a

Then rewrite the work-item gives us (a -W-> a), which is soluble via Refl.
So we add one more clause (KK3) to the kick-out criteria:

    * (KK3: completeness)
      If not(fs >= fw)   (KK3a)
      * (KK3b) If the role of `fs` is Nominal:
           kick out if `rhs_s = lhs_w`
      * (KK3c) If the role of `fs` is Representational:
           kick out if `rhs_s` is of form `(lhs_w t1 .. tn)`

Wrinkles:

* (KK3a) All this can only happen if the work-item can rewrite the inert
  one, /but not vice versa/; that is not(fs >= fw).  It is useless to kick
  out if (fs >= fw) becuase then the work-item is already fully rewritten
  by the inert item.  And too much kick-out is positively harmful.
  (Historical example #14363.)

* (KK3b) addresses teh main example above for KK3. Another way to understand
  (KK3b) is that we treat an inert item
        a -f-> b
  in the same way as
        b -f-> a
  So if we kick out one, we should kick out the other.  The orientation
  is somewhat accidental.

* (KK3c) When considering roles, we also need the second clause (KK3b). Consider
      work-item    c -G/N-> a
      inert-item   a -W/R-> b c
  The work-item doesn't get rewritten by the inert, because (>=) doesn't hold.
  But we don't kick out the inert item because not (W/R >= W/R).  So we just
  add the work item. But then, consider if we hit the following:
      work-item    b -G/N-> Id
      inert-items  a -W/R-> b c
                 c -G/N-> a
    where
      newtype Id x = Id x

  For similar reasons, if we only had (KK3a), we wouldn't kick the
  representational inert out. And then, we'd miss solving the inert, which now
  reduced to reflexivity.

  The solution here is to kick out representational inerts whenever the lhs of a
  work item is "exposed", where exposed means being at the head of the top-level
  application chain (lhs t1 .. tn).  See head_is_new_lhs. This is encoded in
  (KK3c)).


Note [Flavours with roles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system described in Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities]
discusses an abstract
set of flavours. In GHC, flavours have two components: the flavour proper,
taken from {Wanted, Given} and the equality relation (often called
role), taken from {NomEq, ReprEq}.
When substituting w.r.t. the inert set,
as described in Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities],
we must be careful to respect all components of a flavour.
For example, if we have

  inert set: a -G/R-> Int
             b -G/R-> Bool

  type role T nominal representational

and we wish to compute S(W/R, T a b), the correct answer is T a Bool, NOT
T Int Bool. The reason is that T's first parameter has a nominal role, and
thus rewriting a to Int in T a b is wrong. Indeed, this non-congruence of
substitution means that the proof in Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities] may
need to be revisited, but we don't think that the end conclusion is wrong.

{- Note [kickOutRewritable]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See also Note [inert_eqs: the inert equalities].

When we add a new inert equality (lhs ~N ty) to the inert set,
we must kick out any inert items that could be rewritten by the
new equality, to maintain the inert-set invariants.

  - We want to kick out an existing inert constraint if
    a) the new constraint can rewrite the inert one
    b) 'lhs' is free in the inert constraint (so that it *will*)
       rewrite it if we kick it out.

    For (b) we use anyRewritableCanLHS, which examines the types /and
    kinds/ that are directly visible in the type. Hence
    we will have exposed all the rewriting we care about to make the
    most precise kinds visible for matching classes etc. No need to
    kick out constraints that mention type variables whose kinds
    contain this LHS!

  - We don't kick out constraints from inert_solved_dicts, and
    inert_solved_funeqs optimistically. But when we lookup we have to
    take the substitution into account

NB: we could in principle avoid kick-out:
  a) When unifying a meta-tyvar from an outer level, because
     then the entire implication will be iterated; see
     Note [The Unification Level Flag] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.

  b) For Givens, after a unification.  By (GivenInv) in GHC.Tc.Utils.TcType
     Note [TcLevel invariants], a Given can't include a meta-tyvar from
     its own level, so it falls under (a).  Of course, we must still
     kick out Givens when adding a new non-unification Given.

But kicking out more vigorously may lead to earlier unification and fewer
iterations, so we don't take advantage of these possibilities.

Note [Rewrite insolubles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have an insoluble alpha ~ [alpha], which is insoluble
because an occurs check.  And then we unify alpha := [Int].  Then we
really want to rewrite the insoluble to [Int] ~ [[Int]].  Now it can
be decomposed.  Otherwise we end up with a "Can't match [Int] ~
[[Int]]" which is true, but a bit confusing because the outer type
constructors match.

Hence:
 * In the main simplifier loops in GHC.Tc.Solver (solveWanteds,
   simpl_loop), we feed the insolubles in solveSimpleWanteds,
   so that they get rewritten (albeit not solved).

 * We kick insolubles out of the inert set, if they can be
   rewritten (see GHC.Tc.Solver.Monad.kick_out_rewritable)

 * We rewrite those insolubles in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality
   See Note [Make sure that insolubles are fully rewritten]
   in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality

{- Note [What might equal later?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must determine whether a Given might later equal a Wanted. We
definitely need to account for the possibility that any metavariable
might be arbitrarily instantiated. Yet we do *not* want
to allow skolems in to be instantiated, as we've already rewritten
with respect to any Givens. (We're solving a Wanted here, and so
all Givens have already been processed.)

This is best understood by example.

1. C alpha  ~?  C Int

   That given certainly might match later.

2. C a  ~?  C Int

   No. No new givens are going to arise that will get the `a` to rewrite
   to Int.

3. C alpha[tv]   ~?  C Int

   That alpha[tv] is a TyVarTv, unifiable only with other type variables.
   It cannot equal later.

4. C (F alpha)   ~?   C Int

   Sure -- that can equal later, if we learn something useful about alpha.

5. C (F alpha[tv])  ~?  C Int

   This, too, might equal later. Perhaps we have [G] F b ~ Int elsewhere.
   Or maybe we have C (F alpha[tv] beta[tv]), these unify with each other,
   and F x x = Int. Remember: returning True doesn't commit ourselves to
   anything.

6. C (F a)  ~?  C a

   No, this won't match later. If we could rewrite (F a) or a, we would
   have by now. But see also Red Herring below.

7. C (Maybe alpha)  ~?  C alpha

   We say this cannot equal later, because it would require
   alpha := Maybe (Maybe (Maybe ...)). While such a type can be contrived,
   we choose not to worry about it. See Note [Infinitary substitution in lookup]
   in GHC.Core.InstEnv. Getting this wrong let to #19107, tested in
   typecheck/should_compile/T19107.

8. C cbv   ~?  C Int
   where cbv = F a

   The cbv is a cycle-breaker var which stands for F a. See
   Note [Type equality cycles] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality
   This is just like case 6, and we say "no". Saying "no" here is
   essential in getting the parser to type-check, with its use of DisambECP.

9. C cbv   ~?   C Int
   where cbv = F alpha

   Here, we might indeed equal later. Distinguishing between
   this case and Example 8 is why we need the InertSet in mightEqualLater.

10. C (F alpha, Int)  ~?  C (Bool, F alpha)

   This cannot equal later, because F a would have to equal both Bool and
   Int.

To deal with type family applications, we use the Core flattener. See
Note [Flattening type-family applications when matching instances] in GHC.Core.Unify.
The Core flattener replaces all type family applications with
fresh variables. The next question: should we allow these fresh
variables in the domain of a unifying substitution?

A type family application that mentions only skolems (example 6) is settled:
any skolems would have been rewritten w.r.t. Givens by now. These type family
applications match only themselves. A type family application that mentions
metavariables, on the other hand, can match anything. So, if the original type
family application contains a metavariable, we use BindMe to tell the unifier
to allow it in the substitution. On the other hand, a type family application
with only skolems is considered rigid.

This treatment fixes #18910 and is tested in
typecheck/should_compile/InstanceGivenOverlap{,2}

Red Herring
~~~~~~~~~~~
In #21208, we have this scenario:

instance forall b. C b
[G] C a[sk]
[W] C (F a[sk])

What should we do with that wanted? According to the logic above, the Given
cannot match later (this is example 6), and so we use the global instance.
But wait, you say: What if we learn later (say by a future type instance F a = a)
that F a unifies with a? That looks like the Given might really match later!

This mechanism described in this Note is *not* about this kind of situation, however.
It is all asking whether a Given might match the Wanted *in this run of the solver*.
It is *not* about whether a variable might be instantiated so that the Given matches,
or whether a type instance introduced in a downstream module might make the Given match.
The reason we care about what might match later is only about avoiding order-dependence.
That is, we don't want to commit to a course of action that depends on seeing constraints
in a certain order. But an instantiation of a variable and a later type instance
don't introduce order dependency in this way, and so mightMatchLater is right to ignore
these possibilities.

Here is an example, with no type families, that is perhaps clearer:

instance forall b. C (Maybe b)
[G] C (Maybe Int)
[W] C (Maybe a)

What to do? We *might* say that the Given could match later and should thus block
us from using the global instance. But we don't do this. Instead, we rely on class
coherence to say that choosing the global instance is just fine, even if later we
call a function with (a := Int). After all, in this run of the solver, [G] C (Maybe Int)
will definitely never match [W] C (Maybe a). (Recall that we process Givens before
Wanteds, so there is no [G] a ~ Int hanging about unseen.)

Interestingly, in the first case (from #21208), the behavior changed between
GHC 8.10.7 and GHC 9.2, with the latter behaving correctly and the former
reporting overlapping instances.

Test case: typecheck/should_compile/T21208.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we have two Given constraints both of type (C tys), say, which should
we keep?  More subtle than you might think! This is all implemented in
solveOneFromTheOther.

  1) Constraints come from different levels (different_level_strategy)

      - For implicit parameters we want to keep the innermost (deepest)
        one, so that it overrides the outer one.
        See Note [Shadowing of implicit parameters] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict

      - For everything else, we want to keep the outermost one.  Reason: that
        makes it more likely that the inner one will turn out to be unused,
        and can be reported as redundant.  See Note [Tracking redundant constraints]
        in GHC.Tc.Solver.

        It transpires that using the outermost one is responsible for an
        8% performance improvement in nofib cryptarithm2, compared to
        just rolling the dice.  I didn't investigate why.

  2) Constraints coming from the same level (i.e. same implication)

       (a) If both are GivenSCOrigin, choose the one that is unblocked if possible
           according to Note [Solving superclass constraints] in GHC.Tc.TyCl.Instance.

       (b) Prefer constraints that are not superclass selections. Example:

             f :: (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Bool
             f x = x == x

           Eager superclass expansion gives us two [G] Eq a constraints. We
           want to keep the one from the user-written Eq a, not the superclass
           selection. This means we report the Ord a as redundant with
           -Wredundant-constraints, not the Eq a.

           Getting this wrong was #20602. See also
           Note [Tracking redundant constraints] in GHC.Tc.Solver.

       (c) If both are GivenSCOrigin, chooose the one with the shallower
           superclass-selection depth, in the hope of identifying more correct
           redundant constraints. This is really a generalization of point (b),
           because the superclass depth of a non-superclass constraint is 0.

           (If the levels differ, we definitely won't have both with GivenSCOrigin.)

       (d) Finally, when there is still a choice, use KeepInert rather than
           KeepWork, for two reasons:
             - to avoid unnecessary munging of the inert set.
             - to cut off superclass loops; see Note [Superclass loops] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Dict

Doing the level-check for implicit parameters, rather than making the work item
always override, is important.  Consider

    data T a where { T1 :: (?x::Int) => T Int; T2 :: T a }

    f :: (?x::a) => T a -> Int
    f T1 = ?x
    f T2 = 3

We have a [G] (?x::a) in the inert set, and at the pattern match on T1 we add
two new givens in the work-list:  [G] (?x::Int)
                                  [G] (a ~ Int)
Now consider these steps
  - process a~Int, kicking out (?x::a)
  - process (?x::Int), the inner given, adding to inert set
  - process (?x::a), the outer given, overriding the inner given
Wrong!  The level-check ensures that the inner implicit parameter wins.
(Actually I think that the order in which the work-list is processed means
that this chain of events won't happen, but that's very fragile.)
