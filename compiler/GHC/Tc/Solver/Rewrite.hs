{- Note [Rewriter EqRels]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When rewriting, we need to know which equality relation -- nominal
or representational -- we should be respecting.  This is controlled
by the `re_eq_rel` field of RewriteEnv.

* When rewriting primitive /representational/ equalities, (t1 ~# t2),
  we set re_eq_rel=ReprEq.
* For all other constraints, we set re_eq_rel=NomEq

See Note [The rewrite-role of a constraint] in GHC.Tc.Types.Constraint.

The only difference is that when re_eq_rel=ReprEq
* we rewrite variables by representational equalities
* we unwrap newtypes

Note [Rewriter CtLoc]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rewriter does eager type-family reduction.
Type families might loop, and we
don't want GHC to do so. A natural solution is to have a bounded depth
to these processes. A central difficulty is that such a solution isn't
quite compositional. For example, say it takes F Int 10 steps to get to Bool.
How many steps does it take to get from F Int -> F Int to Bool -> Bool?
10? 20? What about getting from Const Char (F Int) to Char? 11? 1? Hard to
know and hard to track. So, we punt, essentially. We store a CtLoc in
the RewriteEnv and just update the environment when recurring. In the
TyConApp case, where there may be multiple type families to rewrite,
we just copy the current CtLoc into each branch. If any branch hits the
stack limit, then the whole thing fails.

A consequence of this is that setting the stack limits appropriately
will be essentially impossible. So, the official recommendation if a
stack limit is hit is to disable the check entirely. Otherwise, there
will be baffling, unpredictable errors.

Note [Phantoms in the rewriter]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

data Proxy p = Proxy

and we're rewriting (Proxy ty) w.r.t. ReprEq. Then, we know that `ty`
is really irrelevant -- it will be ignored when solving for representational
equality later on. So, we omit rewriting `ty` entirely. This may
violate the expectation of "xi"s for a bit, but the canonicaliser will
soon throw out the phantoms when decomposing a TyConApp. (Or, the
canonicaliser will emit an insoluble, in which case we get
a better error message anyway.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  rewrite ty  ==>  Reduction co xi
    where
      xi has no reducible type functions
         has no skolems that are mapped in the inert set
         has no filled-in metavariables
      co :: ty ~ xi (coercions in reductions are always left-to-right)

Key invariants:
  (F0) co :: zonk(ty') ~ xi   where zonk(ty') ~ zonk(ty)
  (F1) typeKind(xi) succeeds and returns a fully zonked kind
  (F2) typeKind(xi) `eqType` zonk(typeKind(ty))

Note that it is rewrite's job to try to reduce *every type function it sees*.

Rewriting also:
  * zonks, removing any metavariables, and
  * applies the substitution embodied in the inert set

Because rewriting zonks and the returned coercion ("co" above) is also
zonked, it's possible that (co :: ty ~ xi) isn't quite true. So, instead,
we can rely on this fact:

  (F0) co :: zonk(ty') ~ xi, where zonk(ty') ~ zonk(ty)

Note that the right-hand type of co is *always* precisely xi. The left-hand
type may or may not be ty, however: if ty has unzonked filled-in metavariables,
then the left-hand type of co will be the zonk-equal to ty.
It is for this reason that we occasionally have to explicitly zonk,
when (co :: ty ~ xi) is important even before we zonk the whole program.
For example, see the RTRNotFollowed case in rewriteTyVar.

Why have these invariants on rewriting? Because we sometimes use typeKind
during canonicalisation, and we want this kind to be zonked (e.g., see
GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.canEqCanLHS).

Rewriting is always homogeneous. That is, the kind of the result of rewriting is
always the same as the kind of the input, modulo zonking. More formally:

  (F2) zonk(typeKind(ty)) `eqType` typeKind(xi)

This invariant means that the kind of a rewritten type might not itself be rewritten.

Note that we prefer to leave type synonyms unexpanded when possible,
so when the rewriter encounters one, it first asks whether its
transitive expansion contains any type function applications or is
forgetful -- that is, omits one or more type variables in its RHS.  If so,
it expands the synonym and proceeds; if not, it simply returns the
unexpanded synonym. See also Note [Rewriting synonyms].

Where do we actually perform rewriting within a type? See Note [Rewritable] in
GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.

Note [rewrite_args performance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In programs with lots of type-level evaluation, rewrite_args becomes
part of a tight loop. For example, see test perf/compiler/T9872a, which
calls rewrite_args a whopping 7,106,808 times. It is thus important
that rewrite_args be efficient.

Performance testing showed that the current implementation is indeed
efficient. It's critically important that zipWithAndUnzipM be
specialized to TcS, and it's also quite helpful to actually `inline`
it. On test T9872a, here are the allocation stats (Dec 16, 2014):

 * Unspecialized, uninlined:     8,472,613,440 bytes allocated in the heap
 * Specialized, uninlined:       6,639,253,488 bytes allocated in the heap
 * Specialized, inlined:         6,281,539,792 bytes allocated in the heap

To improve performance even further, rewrite_args_nom is split off
from rewrite_args, as nominal equality is the common case. This would
be natural to write using mapAndUnzipM, but even inlined, that function
is not as performant as a hand-written loop.

 * mapAndUnzipM, inlined:        7,463,047,432 bytes allocated in the heap
 * hand-written recursion:       5,848,602,848 bytes allocated in the heap

If you make any change here, pay close attention to the T9872{a,b,c} tests
and T5321Fun.

If we need to make this yet more performant, a possible way forward is to
duplicate the rewriter code for the nominal case, and make that case
faster. This doesn't seem quite worth it, yet.

Note [rewrite_exact_fam_app performance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once we've got a rewritten rhs, we extend the famapp-cache to record
the result. Doing so can save lots of work when the same redex shows up more
than once. Note that we record the link from the redex all the way to its
*final* value, not just the single step reduction.

If we can reduce the family application right away (the first call
to try_to_reduce), we do *not* add to the cache. There are two possibilities
here: 1) we just read the result from the cache, or 2) we used one type
family instance. In either case, recording the result in the cache doesn't
save much effort the next time around. And adding to the cache here is
actually disastrous: it more than doubles the allocations for T9872a. So
we skip adding to the cache here.

{- Note [Do not rewrite newtypes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We flirted with unwrapping newtypes in the rewriter -- see GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality
Note [Unwrap newtypes first]. But that turned out to be a bad idea because
of recursive newtypes, as that Note says.  So be careful if you re-add it!

Note [Rewriting synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not expanding synonyms aggressively improves error messages, and
keeps types smaller. But we need to take care.

Suppose
   type Syn a = Int
   type instance F Bool = Syn (F Bool)
   [G] F Bool ~ Syn (F Bool)

If we don't expand the synonym, we'll get a spurious occurs-check
failure. This is normally what occCheckExpand takes care of, but
the LHS is a type family application, and occCheckExpand (already
complex enough as it is) does not know how to expand to avoid
a type family application.

In addition, expanding the forgetful synonym like this
will generally yield a *smaller* type. To wit, if we spot
S ( ... F tys ... ), where S is forgetful, we don't want to bother
doing hard work simplifying (F tys). We thus expand forgetful
synonyms, but not others.

isForgetfulSynTyCon returns True more often than it needs to, so
we err on the side of more expansion.

We also, of course, must expand type synonyms that mention type families,
so those families can get reduced.

Note [How to normalise a family application]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given an exactly saturated family application, how should we normalise it?
This Note spells out the algorithm and its reasoning.

First, we attempt to directly rewrite the type family application,
without simplifying any of the arguments first, in an attempt to avoid
doing unnecessary work.

STEP 1a. Call the rewriting plugins. If any plugin rewrites the type family
application, jump to FINISH.

STEP 1b. Try the famapp-cache. If we get a cache hit, jump to FINISH.

STEP 1c. Try top-level instances. Remember: we haven't simplified the arguments
  yet. Example:
    type instance F (Maybe a) = Int
    target: F (Maybe (G Bool))
  Instead of first trying to simplify (G Bool), we use the instance first. This
  avoids the work of simplifying G Bool.

  If an instance is found, jump to FINISH.

STEP 2: At this point we rewrite all arguments. This might expose more
  information, which might allow plugins to make progress, or allow us to
  pick up a top-level instance.

STEP 3. Try the inerts. Note that we try the inerts *after* rewriting the
  arguments, because the inerts will have rewritten LHSs.

  If an inert is found, jump to FINISH.

Next, we try STEP 1 again, as we might be able to make further progress after
having rewritten the arguments:

STEP 4a. Query the rewriting plugins again.

  If any plugin supplies a rewriting, jump to FINISH.

STEP 4b. Try the famapp-cache again.

  If we get a cache hit, jump to FINISH.

STEP 4c. Try top-level instances again.

  If an instance is found, jump to FINISH.

STEP 5: GIVEUP. No progress to be made. Return what we have. (Do not FINISH.)

FINISH 1. We've made a reduction, but the new type may still have more
  work to do. So rewrite the new type.

FINISH 2. Add the result to the famapp-cache, connecting the type we started
  with to the one we ended with.

Because STEP 1{a,b,c} and STEP 4{a,b,c} happen the same way, they are abstracted into
try_to_reduce.

FINISH is naturally implemented in `finish`. But, Note [rewrite_exact_fam_app performance]
tells us that we should not add to the famapp-cache after STEP 1. So `finish`
is inlined in that case, and only FINISH 1 is performed.

Note [An alternative story for the inert substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(This entire note is just background, left here in case we ever want
 to return the previous state of affairs)

We used (GHC 7.8) to have this story for the inert substitution inert_eqs

 * 'a' is not in fvs(ty)
 * They are *inert* in the weaker sense that there is no infinite chain of
   (i1 `eqCanRewrite` i2), (i2 `eqCanRewrite` i3), etc

This means that rewriting must be recursive, but it does allow
  [G] a ~ [b]
  [G] b ~ Maybe c

This avoids "saturating" the Givens, which can save a modest amount of work.
It is easy to implement, in GHC.Tc.Solver.InertSet.kickOutRewritableLHS, by
only kicking out an inert only if
        (a) the work item can rewrite the inert AND
        (b) the inert cannot rewrite the work item

This is significantly harder to think about. It can save a LOT of work
in occurs-check cases, but we don't care about them much.  #5837
is an example, but it causes trouble only with the old (pre-Fall 2020)
rewriting story. It is unclear if there is any gain w.r.t. to
the new story.
