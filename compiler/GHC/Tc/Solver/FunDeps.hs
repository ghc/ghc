{- Note [Overview of functional dependencies in type inference]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is our plan for dealing with functional dependencies

* When we have failed to solve a Wanted constraint, do this
  - (GEN-FD) Generate any fundep-equalities [FunDepEqns] from that constraint.
  - (SOLVE-FD) Try to solve that [FunDepEqns]
  - (KICK-FD) If any unifications happened,
       * kick out any inert constraints that mention the unified variables
       * send the current constraint back to the start of the pipeline;
         it might now be soluble, and it probably isn't inert

* (GEN-FD) How we generate those [FunDepEqns] varies:
       - tryDictFunDeps: for class constraints (C t1 .. tn)
         we look at top-level instances and inert Givens
       - tryEqFunDeps: for type-family equalities (F t1 .. tn ~ ty)
         we look at top-level family instances
                    and inert Given family equalities

* (SOLVE-FD) We use `solveFunDeps` to solve the [FunDepEqns] in a nested
  solver.  Key property:

      The ONLY effect of `solveFunDeps` is possibly to perform unifications:
      - It entirely discards any unsolved fundep equalities.
      - It entirely discards any evidence arising from solving fundep equalities

* (KICK-FD) if we did any unifications in (SOLVE-FD), we start again with the
  current unsolved Wanted.  It might now be soluble!

* For Given constraints, things are different:
    - tryDictFunDeps: we do nothing
    - tryEqFunDeps: for type-family equalities, we can produce new
        actual evidence for built-in type families.  E.g.
             [G] co : 3 ~ x + 1
        We can produce new evidence
             [G] co' : x ~ 2
  So we generate and emit fresh Givens.  See
     `improveGivenTopFunEqs` and `improveGivenLocalFunEqs`
  No unification is involved here, just emitting new Givens.

Wrinkles

(FD1) Consequences for error messages.
  Because we discard any unsolved FunDepEqns, we get better error messages.
  Consider   class C a b | a -> b
             instance C Int Bool
  and [W] C Int Char
  We'll get an insoluble fundep-equality  (Char ~ Bool), but it's very
  unhelpful to report it.  Much better just to say
     No instance for C Int Bool

  Similarly if had [W] C Int S, [W] C Int T, it is not helpful to
  complain about insoluble (S ~ T).

(FD2) We discard all evidence in Step 2.  We could go further and offer evidence
  from fundeps, but that would require new evidence forms, and an extension to
  FC, so we don't do that right now (Dec 14).


Note [FunDep and implicit parameter reactions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, our story of interacting two dictionaries (or a dictionary
and top-level instances) for functional dependencies (including implicit
parameters), is that we simply produce new Wanted equalities.  So for example

        class D a b | a -> b where ...
    Inert:
        [G] d1 : D Int Bool
    WorkItem:
        [W] d2 : D Int alpha

    We generate the extra work item
        [W] cv : alpha ~ Bool
    where 'cv' is currently unused.  However, this new item can perhaps be
    spontaneously solved to become given and react with d2,
    discharging it in favour of a new constraint d2' thus:
        [W] d2' : D Int Bool
        d2 := d2' |> D Int cv
    Now d2' can be discharged from d1

We could be more aggressive and try to *immediately* solve the dictionary
using those extra equalities.

If that were the case with the same inert set and work item we might discard
d2 directly:

        [W] cv : alpha ~ Bool
        d2 := d1 |> D Int cv

But in general it's a bit painful to figure out the necessary coercion,
so we just take the first approach. Here is a better example. Consider:
    class C a b c | a -> b
And:
     [G] d1 : C T Int Char
     [W] d2 : C T beta Int
In this case, it's *not even possible* to solve the wanted immediately.
So we should simply output the functional dependency and add this guy
[but NOT its superclasses] back in the worklist. Even worse:
     [G] d1 : C T Int beta
     [W] d2: C T beta Int
Then it is solvable, but its very hard to detect this on the spot.

It's exactly the same with implicit parameters, except that the
"aggressive" approach would be much easier to implement.

Note [Deeper TcLevel for partial improvement unification variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this (#12522):
  type family F x = t | t -> x
  type instance F (a, Int) = (Int, G a)
where G is injective; and wanted constraints
  [W] F (alpha, beta) ~ (Int, <some type>)

The injectivity will give rise to fundep equalities
  [W] gamma1 ~ alpha
  [W] Int ~ beta

The fresh unification variable `gamma1` comes from the fact that we can only do
"partial improvement" here; see Section 5.2 of "Injective type families for
Haskell" (HS'15).

Now it is crucial that, when solving,
  we unify    gamma1 := alpha    (YES)
  and not     alpha := gamma1    (NO)

Why?  Because if we do (NO) we'll think we have made some progress
(some unification has happened), and hence go round again; but actually all we
have done is to replace `alpha` with `gamma1`.

These "fresh unification variables" in fundep-equalities are ubiquitous.
For example
      class C a b | a -> b
      instance .. => C Int [x]
If we see
      [W] C Int alpha
we'll generate a fundep-equality   [W] alpha ~ [beta1]
where `beta1` is one of those "fresh unification variables"

This problem shows up in several guises; see (at the bottom)
  * Historical Note [Improvement orientation]
  * Historical Note [Fundeps with instances, and equality orientation]

The solution is super-simple:

  * A fundep-equality is described by `FunDepEqns`, whose `fd_qtvs` field
    explicitly lists the "fresh variables"

  * Function `instantiateFunDepEqn` instantiates a `FunDepEqns`, and CRUCIALLY
    (via `nestFunDepsTcS` gives the new unification variables a level one
    deeper than the current level.

  * Now, given `alpha ~ beta`, all the unification machinery guarantees, to
    unify the variable with the deeper level.  See GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify
    Note [Deeper level on the left].  That ensures that the fresh `gamma1`
    will be eliminated in favour of `alpha`. Hooray.

  * Better still, we solve the [FunDepEqns] with
      solveFunDeps :: CtEvidence -> [FunDepEqns] -> TcS Bool
    It uses `reportFineGrainUnifications` to see if any unification happened at this
    level or outside -- that is, it does NOT report unifications to the fresh
    unification variables.  So `solveFunDeps` returns True only if it
    unifies a variable /other than/ the fresh ones.  Bingo.

Another victory for levels numbers!

Note [Do local fundeps before top-level instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider #14745
   class C a b c | a -> b c

   instance C Int Bool Char

   f :: (C Int b c) => a -> c
   f = undefined

From the ambiguity check for `f` we get
  [G] d1: C Int b c
  [W] d2: C Int beta c

This is easily solved by beta:=b, from the fundep between Given and Wanted.
But if we tried the top-level instance first, we'd get
   beta~Int, c~Char
which we can't solve. We'll ignore the insoluble c~Char, but we will still
have unified beta:=Int, leaving [W] C Int c, which we can't solve.

Conclusion: for fundeps, interact with local dictionaries before top-level instances.

Something very similar happens for type families.  See #13651, and test T13651.

Note [Do fundeps last]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider T4254b:
  class FD a b | a -> b where { op :: a -> b }

  instance FD Int Bool

  foo :: forall a b. (a~Int,FD a b) => a -> Bool
  foo = op

(DFL1) Try local fundeps first.
  From the ambiguity check on the type signature we get
    [G] FD Int b
    [W] FD Int beta
  If we interact that Wanted with /both/ the top-level instance, /and/ the
  local Given, we'll get
      beta ~ Int   and     beta ~ b
  respectively.  That would generate (b~Bool), which would fail.  I think
  it doesn't matter which of the two we pick, but historically we have
  picked the local-fundeps first.

  #14745 is another example

(DFL2) Try solving from top-level instances before fundeps.
  From the definition `foo = op` we get
    [G] FD Int b
    [W] FD Int Bool
  We solve this from the top level instance before even trying fundeps.
  If we did try fundeps, we'd generate [W] b ~ Bool, which fails.

  (DFL2) is achieved by trying fundeps only on /unsolved/ Wanteds.

Note [Weird fundeps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider   class Het a b | a -> b where
              het :: m (f c) -> a -> m b

           class GHet (a :: * -> *) (b :: * -> *) | a -> b
           instance            GHet (K a) (K [a])
           instance Het a b => GHet (K a) (K b)

The two instances don't actually conflict on their fundeps,
although it's pretty strange.  So they are both accepted. Now
try   [W] GHet (K Int) (K Bool)
This triggers fundeps from both instance decls;
      [W] K Bool ~ K [a]
      [W] K Bool ~ K beta
And there's a risk of complaining about Bool ~ [a].  But in fact
the Wanted matches the second instance, so we never get as far
as the fundeps.

#7875 is a case in point.

{- Note [No Given/Given fundeps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For /non-built-in/ type families we do not create constraints from:
* Given/Given interactions via functional dependencies or type-family
  injectivity annotations.
* Given/instance fundep interactions via functional dependencies or
  type family injectivity annotations.

NB: for /built-in type families/ we DO create constraints,
    because we can make evidence for them.
    See Note [Given/Given fundeps for built-in type families].

In this Note, all these interactions are called just "fundeps".

We ignore such fundeps for several reasons:

1. These fundeps will never serve a purpose in accepting more
   programs: Given constraints do not contain metavariables that could
   be unified via exploring fundeps. They *could* be useful in
   discovering inaccessible code. However, the constraints will be
   Wanteds, and as such will cause errors (not just warnings) if they
   go unsolved. Maybe there is a clever way to get the right
   inaccessible code warnings, but the path forward is far from
   clear. #12466 has further commentary.

   NB: for built-in type families we can do a lot better.
   See Note [Given/Given fundeps for built-in type families]

2. Furthermore, here is a case where a Given/instance interaction is actively
   harmful (from dependent/should_compile/RaeJobTalk):

       type family a == b :: Bool
       type family Not a = r | r -> a where
         Not False = True
         Not True  = False

       [G] Not (a == b) ~ True

   Reacting this Given with the equations for Not could produce
      [W] a == b ~ False
   This is indeed a true consequence, and would make sense as a fresh Given.
   But we don't have a way to produce evidence for fundeps, as a Wanted it
   is /useless/.

   (Historical aside: we used to keep fundep-generated Wanteds around, so
   this insoluble constraint would generate a (misleading) error message.
   Nowadays we discard unsolved fundeps. End of historial aside.)

3. #20922 showed a subtle different problem with Given/instance fundeps.
      type family ZipCons (as :: [k]) (bssx :: [[k]]) = (r :: [[k]]) | r -> as bssx where
        ZipCons (a ': as) (bs ': bss) = (a ': bs) ': ZipCons as bss
        ...

      tclevel = 4
      [G] ZipCons is1 iss ~ (i : is2) : jss

   (The tclevel=4 means that this Given is at level 4.)  The fundep tells us that
   'iss' must be of form (is2 : beta[4]) where beta[4] is a fresh unification
   variable; we don't know what type it stands for. So we would emit
      [W] iss ~ is2 : beta[4]

   Again we can't prove that equality. (Historical aside: in the past
   we used to keep fundep Wanteds around, and then it'll rewrite `iss` to
   (is2:beta) in deeply nested constraints inside this implication,
   where beta is untouchable (under other equality constraints), leading
   to other insoluble constraints.  End of historical aside.)

The bottom line:
   since we have no evidence for them, we should ignore
   Given/Given and Given/instance fundeps entirely, for
     * Type-class fundeps
     * Fundeps for user-defined type families

Note [Given/Given fundeps for built-in type families]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For built-in type families we /can/ generate real evidence from Given/Given
or Given/instance interactions.  For example if we have
   [G] x+3 ~ 7
then we can deduce
   [G] x ~ 4
Or
   [G] x++[3] ~ [5,3]
we can deduce
   [] x ~ [5]

This new Given evidence is generated by `tryGivenBuiltinFamEqFDs` supported
by the extensive code in GHC.Builtin.Types.Literals.

{- Note [Type inference for type families with injectivity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have a type family with an injectivity annotation:
    type family F a b = r | r -> b

Here is the plan; see also Note [Injective type families]
in GHC.Core.TyCon):

For /injective/, /user-defined/ type families

* (INJFAM:Given) For Given constraints
  - When F is user-defined, do nothing at all
    See Note [No Given/Given fundeps]
  - When F is a built-in type family, we can do better;
    See Note [Given/Given fundeps for built-in type families]

* (INJFAM:Wanted/Self) see `mkLocalUserFamEqFDs`
    work item: [W] F s1 s2 ~ F t1 t2
  We can generate FunDepEqns: (s2 ~ t2)

* (INJFAM:Wanted/other) see `mkLocalUserFamEqFDs`
    work item: [W]   F s1 s2 ~ rhs   -- Wanted
    inert:     [G/W] F t2 t2 ~ rhs   -- Same `rhs`, Given or Wanted
  We can generate FunDepEqns: (s2 ~ t2)

* (INJFAM:Wanted/top) see `mkTopUserFamEqFDs`
    work item: [W] F s1 s2 ~ rhs
    type instance forall a b c. F t1 t2 ~ top_rhs
  and we can /match/ the LHS, so that
     S(top_rhs) = rhs
  then we can generate the FunDepEqns:  forall a c. s2 ~ S(t2)
  But see wrinkle (TIF1), (TIF2)

For /built-in/ type families, it's pretty similar, except that

* We generate new Given constraints, /with evidence/, from Givens.
  e.g. from             [G] x+2 ~ 7
       we can generate  [G] x ~ 5
  See `tryGivenBuiltinFamEqFDs`

* For Wanteds things go much as for user-defined families.
   * mkLocalbuiltinFamEqFDs
   * mkTopBuiltinFamEqFDs

(TIF1) Generating fundeps from a top-level type instance is covered in
  Section 5.2 in the Injective Type Families paper. It's a bit tricky.
  Consider
     type family F @k (a::k) (b::k) = r | r -> k b
     type instance forall k (a::k) (b::k). F @k (Proxy @k a) (Proxy @k b) = Proxy @k a
     [W] F @kappa alpha beta ~ Maybe (Proxy @kappa (delta::kappa))

  we match (Proxy @kappa delta) against the template (Proxy k a), succeeding
  with substitution [k:->kappa, a:->delta].  We want to generate this FunDepEqns
    FDEqn { fd_qtvs = [b:kappa], fd_eqs = [ beta ~ Proxy @kappa b ] }
  Notice that
    * we must quantify the FunDepEqns over `b`, which is not matched; for this
      we will generate a fresh unfication variable in `instantiateFunDepEqn`.
    * we must substitute `k:->kappa` in the kind of `b`.
  This fancy footwork for `fd_qtvs` is done by `trim_qtvs` in
  `mkInjWantedFamEqTopEqns`.

(TIF2) Further to (TIF1), if we are considering a /closed/ type family, we
  must ensure (see Section 5.2 of the paper) that after matching that
  equation would indeed be the one to fire.  So we call `apartnessCheck`
  on the branch to ensure this, in `mkTopUserFamEqFDs`.

Note [Cache-caused loops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is very dangerous to cache a rewritten wanted family equation as 'solved' in our
solved cache (which is the default behaviour or xCtEvidence), because the interaction
may not be contributing towards a solution. Here is an example:

Initial inert set:
  [W] g1 : F a ~ beta1
Work item:
  [W] g2 : F a ~ beta2
The work item will react with the inert yielding the _same_ inert set plus:
    (i)   Will set g2 := g1 `cast` g3
    (ii)  Will add to our solved cache that [S] g2 : F a ~ beta2
    (iii) Will emit [W] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2
Now, the g3 work item will be spontaneously solved to [G] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2
and then it will react the item in the inert ([W] g1 : F a ~ beta1). So it
will set
      g1 := g ; sym g3
and what is g? Well it would ideally be a new goal of type (F a ~ beta2) but
remember that we have this in our solved cache, and it is ... g2! In short we
created the evidence loop:

        g2 := g1 ; g3
        g3 := refl
        g1 := g2 ; sym g3

To avoid this situation we do not cache as solved any workitems (or inert)
which did not really made a 'step' towards proving some goal. Solved's are
just an optimization so we don't lose anything in terms of completeness of
solving.

{- Note [Reverse order of fundep equations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this scenario (from dependent/should_fail/T13135_simple):

  type Sig :: Type -> Type
  data Sig a = SigFun a (Sig a)

  type SmartFun :: forall (t :: Type). Sig t -> Type
  type family SmartFun sig = r | r -> sig where
    SmartFun @Type (SigFun @Type a sig) = a -> SmartFun @Type sig

  [W] SmartFun @kappa sigma ~ (Int -> Bool)

The injectivity of SmartFun allows us to produce two new equalities:

  [W] w1 :: Type ~ kappa
  [W] w2 :: SigFun @Type Int beta ~ sigma

for some fresh (beta :: SigType). The second Wanted here is actually
heterogeneous: the LHS has type Sig Type while the RHS has type Sig kappa.
Of course, if we solve the first wanted first, the second becomes homogeneous.

When looking for injectivity-inspired equalities, we work left-to-right,
producing the two equalities in the order written above. However, these
equalities are then passed into wrapUnifierAndEmit, which will fail, adding these
to the work list. However, the work list operates like a *stack*.
So, because we add w1 and then w2, we process w2 first. This is silly: solving
w1 would unlock w2. So we make sure to add equalities to the work
list in left-to-right order, which requires a few key calls to 'reverse'.

When this was originally conceived, it was necessary to avoid a loop in T13135.
That loop is now avoided by continuing with the kind equality (not the type
equality) in canEqCanLHSHetero (see Note [Equalities with heterogeneous kinds]).
However, the idea of working left-to-right still seems worthwhile (less
kick-out), and so the calls to 'reverse' remain.

This treatment is also used for class-based functional dependencies, although
we do not have a program yet known to exhibit a loop there. It just seems
like the right thing to do.

In general, I believe this is (now, anyway) just an optimisation, not required
to avoid loops.

Historical Note [Improvement orientation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See also Historical Note [Fundeps with instances, and equality orientation],
which describes the Exact Same Problem, with the same solution, but for
functional dependencies.

A very delicate point is the orientation of equalities
arising from injectivity improvement (#12522).  Suppose we have
  type family F x = t | t -> x
  type instance F (a, Int) = (Int, G a)
where G is injective; and wanted constraints

  [W] F (alpha, beta) ~ (Int, <some type>)

The injectivity will give rise to constraints

  [W] gamma1 ~ alpha
  [W] Int ~ beta

The fresh unification variable gamma1 comes from the fact that we
can only do "partial improvement" here; see Section 5.2 of
"Injective type families for Haskell" (HS'15).

Now, it's very important to orient the equations this way round,
so that the fresh unification variable will be eliminated in
favour of alpha.  If we instead had
   [W] alpha ~ gamma1
then we would unify alpha := gamma1; and kick out the wanted
constraint.  But when we substitute it back in, it'd look like
   [W] F (gamma1, beta) ~ fuv
and exactly the same thing would happen again!  Infinite loop.

--->  ToDo: all this fragility has gone away!   Fix the Note! <---

This all seems fragile, and it might seem more robust to avoid
introducing gamma1 in the first place, in the case where the
actual argument (alpha, beta) partly matches the improvement
template.  But that's a bit tricky, esp when we remember that the
kinds much match too; so it's easier to let the normal machinery
handle it.  Instead we are careful to orient the new
equality with the template on the left.  Delicate, but it works.

Historical Note [Fundeps with instances, and equality orientation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Note describes a delicate interaction that constrains the orientation of
equalities. This one is about fundeps, but the /exact/ same thing arises for
type-family injectivity constraints: see Note [Improvement orientation].

doTopFunDepImprovement compares the constraint with all the instance
declarations, to see if we can produce any equalities. E.g
   class C2 a b | a -> b
   instance C Int Bool
Then the constraint (C Int ty) generates the equality [W] ty ~ Bool.

There is a nasty corner in #19415 which led to the typechecker looping:
   class C s t b | s -> t
   instance ... => C (T kx x) (T ky y) Int
   T :: forall k. k -> Type

   work_item: dwrk :: C (T @ka (a::ka)) (T @kb0 (b0::kb0)) Char
      where kb0, b0 are unification vars

   ==> {doTopFunDepImprovement: compare work_item with instance,
        generate /fresh/ unification variables kfresh0, yfresh0,
        emit a new Wanted, and add dwrk to inert set}

   Suppose we emit this new Wanted from the fundep:
       [W] T kb0 (b0::kb0) ~ T kfresh0 (yfresh0::kfresh0)

   ==> {solve that equality kb0 := kfresh0, b0 := yfresh0}
   Now kick out dwrk, since it mentions kb0
   But now we are back to the start!  Loop!

NB1: This example relies on an instance that does not satisfy the
     coverage condition (although it may satisfy the weak coverage
     condition), and hence whose fundeps generate fresh unification
     variables.  Not satisfying the coverage condition is known to
     lead to termination trouble, but in this case it's plain silly.

NB2: In this example, the third parameter to C ensures that the
     instance doesn't actually match the Wanted, so we can't use it to
     solve the Wanted

We solve the problem by (#21703):

    carefully orienting the new Wanted so that all the
    freshly-generated unification variables are on the LHS.

    Thus we call unifyWanteds on
       T kfresh0 (yfresh0::kfresh0) ~ T kb0 (b0::kb0)
    and /NOT/
       T kb0 (b0::kb0) ~ T kfresh0 (yfresh0::kfresh0)

Now we'll unify kfresh0:=kb0, yfresh0:=b0, and all is well.  The general idea
is that we want to preferentially eliminate those freshly-generated
unification variables, rather than unifying older variables, which causes
kick-out etc.

Keeping younger variables on the left also gives very minor improvement in
the compiler performance by having less kick-outs and allocations (-0.1% on
average).  Indeed Historical Note [Eliminate younger unification variables]
in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify describes an earlier attempt to do so systematically,
apparently now in abeyance.

But this is is a delicate solution. We must take care to /preserve/
orientation during solving. Wrinkles:

(W1) We start with
       [W] T kfresh0 (yfresh0::kfresh0) ~ T kb0 (b0::kb0)
     Decompose to
       [W] kfresh0 ~ kb0
       [W] (yfresh0::kfresh0) ~ (b0::kb0)
     Preserve orientation when decomposing!!

(W2) Suppose we happen to tackle the second Wanted from (W1)
     first. Then in canEqCanLHSHetero we emit a /kind/ equality, as
     well as a now-homogeneous type equality
       [W] kco : kfresh0 ~ kb0
       [W] (yfresh0::kfresh0) ~ (b0::kb0) |> (sym kco)
     Preserve orientation in canEqCanLHSHetero!!  (Failing to
     preserve orientation here was the immediate cause of #21703.)

(W3) There is a potential interaction with the swapping done by
     GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.swapOverTyVars.  We think it's fine, but it's
     a slight worry.  See especially Note [TyVar/TyVar orientation] in
     that module.

The trouble is that "preserving orientation" is a rather global invariant,
and sometimes we definitely do want to swap (e.g. Int ~ alpha), so we don't
even have a precise statement of what the invariant is.  The advantage
of the preserve-orientation plan is that it is extremely cheap to implement,
and apparently works beautifully.

--- Alternative plan (1) ---
Rather than have an ill-defined invariant, another possiblity is to
elminate those fresh unification variables at birth, when generating
the new fundep-inspired equalities.

The key idea is to call `instFlexiX` in `emitFunDepWanteds` on only those
type variables that are guaranteed to give us some progress. This means we
have to locally (without calling emitWanteds) identify the type variables
that do not give us any progress.  In the above example, we _know_ that
emitting the two wanteds `kco` and `co` is fruitless.

  Q: How do we identify such no-ops?

  1. Generate a matching substitution from LHS to RHS
        ɸ = [kb0 :-> k0, b0 :->  y0]
  2. Call `instFlexiX` on only those type variables that do not appear in the domain of ɸ
        ɸ' = instFlexiX ɸ (tvs - domain ɸ)
  3. Apply ɸ' on LHS and then call emitWanteds
        unifyWanteds ... (subst ɸ' LHS) RHS

Why will this work?  The matching substitution ɸ will be a best effort
substitution that gives us all the easy solutions. It can be generated with
modified version of `Core/Unify.unify_tys` where we run it in a matching mode
and never generate `SurelyApart` and always return a `MaybeApart Subst`
instead.

The same alternative plan would work for type-family injectivity constraints:
see Note [Improvement orientation] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Equality.
--- End of Alternative plan (1) ---

--- Alternative plan (2) ---
We could have a new flavour of TcTyVar (like `TauTv`, `TyVarTv` etc; see GHC.Tc.Utils.TcType.MetaInfo)
for the fresh unification variables introduced by functional dependencies.  Say `FunDepTv`.  Then in
GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify.swapOverTyVars we could arrange to keep a `FunDepTv` on the left if possible.
Looks possible, but it's one more complication.
--- End of Alternative plan (2) ---


--- Historical note: Failed Alternative Plan (3) ---
Previously we used a flag `cc_fundeps` in `CDictCan`. It would flip to False
once we used a fun dep to hint the solver to break and to stop emitting more
wanteds.  This solution was not complete, and caused a failures while trying
to solve for transitive functional dependencies (test case: T21703)

Historical Note
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Note (anonymous, but related to dict-solving) is rendered obsolete by
 - Danger 1: solved by Note [Instance and Given overlap]
 - Danger 2: solved by fundeps being idempotent

When we spot an equality arising from a functional dependency,
we now use that equality (a "wanted") to rewrite the work-item
constraint right away.  This avoids two dangers

 Danger 1: If we send the original constraint on down the pipeline
           it may react with an instance declaration, and in delicate
           situations (when a Given overlaps with an instance) that
           may produce new insoluble goals: see #4952

 Danger 2: If we don't rewrite the constraint, it may re-react
           with the same thing later, and produce the same equality
           again --> termination worries.
