Note [Valid hole fits include ...]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`findValidHoleFits` returns the "Valid hole fits include ..." message.
For example, look at the following definitions in a file called test.hs:

   import Data.List (inits)

   f :: [String]
   f = _ "hello, world"

The hole in `f` would generate the message:

  • Found hole: _ :: [Char] -> [String]
  • In the expression: _
    In the expression: _ "hello, world"
    In an equation for ‘f’: f = _ "hello, world"
  • Relevant bindings include f :: [String] (bound at test.hs:6:1)

Valid hole fits are found by checking top level identifiers and local bindings
in scope for whether their type can be instantiated to the type of the hole.
Additionally, we also need to check whether all relevant constraints are solved
by choosing an identifier of that type as well, see Note [Relevant constraints]

Since checking for subsumption results in the side-effect of type variables
being unified by the simplifier, we need to take care to restore them after
to being flexible type variables after we've checked for subsumption.
This is to avoid affecting the hole and later checks by prematurely having
unified one of the free unification variables.

When outputting, we sort the hole fits by the size of the types we'd need to
apply by type application to the type of the fit to make it fit. This is done
in order to display "more relevant" suggestions first. Another option is to
sort by building a subsumption graph of fits, i.e. a graph of which fits subsume
what other fits, and then outputting those fits which are subsumed by other
fits (i.e. those more specific than other fits) first. This results in the ones
"closest" to the type of the hole to be displayed first.

To help users understand how the suggested fit works, we also display the values
that the quantified type variables would take if that fit is used, like
`mempty @([Char] -> [String])` and `pure @[] @String` in the example above.
If -XTypeApplications is enabled, this can even be copied verbatim as a
replacement for the hole.

Note [Checking hole fits]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have a hole of type hole_ty, we want to know whether a variable
of type ty is a valid fit for the whole. This is a subsumption check:
we wish to know whether ty <: hole_ty. But, of course, the check
must take into account any givens and relevant constraints.
(See also Note [Relevant constraints]).

For the simplifier to be able to use any givens present in the enclosing
implications to solve relevant constraints, we nest the wanted subsumption
constraints and relevant constraints within the enclosing implications.

As an example, let's look at the following code:

  f :: Show a => a -> String
  f x = show _

Suppose the hole is assigned type a0_a1pd[tau:2].
Here the nested implications are just one level deep, namely:

  [Implic {
      TcLevel = 2
      Skolems = a_a1pa[sk:2]
      No-eqs = True
      Status = Unsolved
      Given = $dShow_a1pc :: Show a_a1pa[sk:2]
      Wanted =
        WC {wc_simple =
              [W] $dShow_a1pe {0}:: Show a0_a1pd[tau:2] (CDictCan(psc))}
      Binds = EvBindsVar<a1pi>
      Needed inner = []
      Needed outer = []
      the type signature for:
        f :: forall a. Show a => a -> String }]

As we can see, the givens say that the skolem
`a_a1pa[sk:2]` fulfills the Show constraint, and that we must prove
the [W] Show a0_a1pd[tau:2] constraint -- that is, whatever fills the
hole must have a Show instance.

When we now check whether `x :: a_a1pa[sk:2]` fits the hole in
`tcCheckHoleFit`, the call to `tcSubType` will end up unifying the meta type
variable `a0_a1pd[tau:2] := a_a1pa[sk:2]`. By wrapping the wanted constraints
needed by tcSubType_NC and the relevant constraints (see Note [Relevant
constraints] for more details) in the nested implications, we can pass the
information in the givens along to the simplifier. For our example, we end up
needing to check whether the following constraints are soluble.

  WC {wc_impl =
        Implic {
          TcLevel = 2
          Skolems = a_a1pa[sk:2]
          No-eqs = True
          Status = Unsolved
          Given = $dShow_a1pc :: Show a_a1pa[sk:2]
          Wanted =
            WC {wc_simple =
                  [W] $dShow_a1pe {0}:: Show a0_a1pd[tau:2] (CNonCanonical)}
          Binds = EvBindsVar<a1pl>
          Needed inner = []
          Needed outer = []
          the type signature for:
            f :: forall a. Show a => a -> String }}

But since `a0_a1pd[tau:2] := a_a1pa[sk:2]` and we have from the nested
implications that Show a_a1pa[sk:2] is a given, this is trivial, and we end up
with a final WC of WC {}, confirming x :: a0_a1pd[tau:2] as a match.

To avoid side-effects on the nested implications, we create a new EvBindsVar so
that any changes to the ev binds during a check remains localised to that check.
In addition, we call withoutUnification to reset any unified metavariables; this
call is actually done outside tcCheckHoleFit so that the results can be formatted
for the user before resetting variables.

Note [Valid refinement hole fits include ...]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the `-frefinement-level-hole-fits=N` flag is given, we additionally look
for "valid refinement hole fits"", i.e. valid hole fits with up to N
additional holes in them.

With `-frefinement-level-hole-fits=0` (the default), GHC will find all
identifiers 'f' (top-level or nested) that will fit in the hole.

With `-frefinement-level-hole-fits=1`, GHC will additionally find all
applications 'f _' that will fit in the hole, where 'f' is an in-scope
identifier, applied to single argument.  It will also report the type of the
needed argument (a new hole).

And similarly as the number of arguments increases

As an example, let's look at the following code:

  f :: [Integer] -> Integer
  f = _

with `-frefinement-level-hole-fits=1`, we'd get:

  Valid refinement hole fits include

    foldl1 (_ :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer)
      with foldl1 @[] @Integer
      where foldl1 :: forall (t :: * -> *).
                      Foldable t =>
                      forall a. (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a
    foldr1 (_ :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer)
      with foldr1 @[] @Integer
      where foldr1 :: forall (t :: * -> *).
                      Foldable t =>
                      forall a. (a -> a -> a) -> t a -> a
    const (_ :: Integer)
      with const @Integer @[Integer]
      where const :: forall a b. a -> b -> a
    ($) (_ :: [Integer] -> Integer)
      with ($) @'GHC.Types.LiftedRep @[Integer] @Integer
      where ($) :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b
    fail (_ :: String)
      with fail @((->) [Integer]) @Integer
      where fail :: forall (m :: * -> *).
                    Monad m =>
                    forall a. String -> m a
    return (_ :: Integer)
      with return @((->) [Integer]) @Integer
      where return :: forall (m :: * -> *). Monad m => forall a. a -> m a
    (Some refinement hole fits suppressed;
      use -fmax-refinement-hole-fits=N or -fno-max-refinement-hole-fits)

Which are hole fits with holes in them. This allows e.g. beginners to
discover the fold functions and similar, but also allows for advanced users
to figure out the valid functions in the Free monad, e.g.

  instance Functor f => Monad (Free f) where
      Pure a >>= f = f a
      Free f >>= g = Free (fmap _a f)

Will output (with -frefinment-level-hole-fits=1):
    Found hole: _a :: Free f a -> Free f b
          Where: ‘a’, ‘b’ are rigid type variables bound by
                  the type signature for:
                    (>>=) :: forall a b. Free f a -> (a -> Free f b) -> Free f b
                  at fms.hs:25:12-14
                ‘f’ is a rigid type variable bound by
    ...
    Relevant bindings include
      g :: a -> Free f b (bound at fms.hs:27:16)
      f :: f (Free f a) (bound at fms.hs:27:10)
      (>>=) :: Free f a -> (a -> Free f b) -> Free f b
        (bound at fms.hs:25:12)
    ...
    Valid refinement hole fits include
      ...
      (=<<) (_ :: a -> Free f b)
        with (=<<) @(Free f) @a @b
        where (=<<) :: forall (m :: * -> *) a b.
                      Monad m =>
                      (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
        (imported from ‘Prelude’ at fms.hs:5:18-22
        (and originally defined in ‘GHC.Base’))
      ...

Where `(=<<) _` is precisely the function we want (we ultimately want `>>= g`).

We find these refinement suggestions by considering hole fits that don't
fit the type of the hole, but ones that would fit if given an additional
argument. We do this by creating a new type variable with `newOpenFlexiTyVar`
(e.g. `t_a1/m[tau:1]`), and then considering hole fits of the type
`t_a1/m[tau:1] -> v` where `v` is the type of the hole.

Since the simplifier is free to unify this new type variable with any type, we
can discover any identifiers that would fit if given another identifier of a
suitable type. This is then generalized so that we can consider any number of
additional arguments by setting the `-frefinement-level-hole-fits` flag to any
number, and then considering hole fits like e.g. `foldl _ _` with two additional
arguments.

To make sure that the refinement hole fits are useful, we check that the types
of the additional holes have a concrete value and not just an invented type
variable. This eliminates suggestions such as `head (_ :: [t0 -> a]) (_ :: t0)`,
and limits the number of less than useful refinement hole fits.

Additionally, to further aid the user in their implementation, we show the
types of the holes the binding would have to be applied to in order to work.
In the free monad example above, this is demonstrated with
`(=<<) (_ :: a -> Free f b)`, which tells the user that the `(=<<)` needs to
be applied to an expression of type `a -> Free f b` in order to match.
If -XScopedTypeVariables is enabled, this hole fit can even be copied verbatim.

Note [Relevant constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As highlighted by #14273, we need to check any relevant constraints as well
as checking for subsumption. Relevant constraints are the simple constraints
whose free unification variables are mentioned in the type of the hole.

In the simplest case, these are all non-hole constraints in the simples, such
as is the case in

  f :: String
  f = show _

Here, the hole is given type a0_a1kv[tau:1]. Then, the emitted constraint is:

  [W] $dShow_a1kw {0}:: Show a0_a1kv[tau:1] (CNonCanonical)

However, when there are multiple holes, we need to be more careful. As an
example, Let's take a look at the following code:

  f :: Show a => a -> String
  f x = show (_b (show _a))

Here there are two holes, `_a` and `_b`. Suppose _a :: a0_a1pd[tau:2] and
_b :: a1_a1po[tau:2]. Then, the simple constraints passed to
findValidHoleFits are:

  [[W] $dShow_a1pe {0}:: Show a0_a1pd[tau:2] (CNonCanonical),
    [W] $dShow_a1pp {0}:: Show a1_a1po[tau:2] (CNonCanonical)]

When we are looking for a match for the hole `_a`, we filter the simple
constraints to the "Relevant constraints", by throwing out any constraints
which do not mention a variable mentioned in the type of the hole. For hole
`_a`, we will then only require that the `$dShow_a1pe` constraint is solved,
since that is the only constraint that mentions any free type variables
mentioned in the hole constraint for `_a`, namely `a_a1pd[tau:2]`, and
similarly for the hole `_b` we only require that the `$dShow_a1pe` constraint
is solved.

Note [Leaking errors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When considering candidates, GHC believes that we're checking for validity in
actual source. However, As evidenced by #15321, #15007 and #15202, this can
cause bewildering error messages. The solution here is simple: if a candidate
would cause the type checker to error, it is not a valid hole fit, and thus it
is discarded.

Note [Speeding up valid hole-fits]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To fix #16875 we noted that a lot of time was being spent on unnecessary work.

When we'd call `tcCheckHoleFit hole hole_ty ty`, we would end up by generating
a constraint to show that `hole_ty ~ ty`, including any constraints in `ty`. For
example, if `hole_ty = Int` and `ty = Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool`,
we'd have `(a_a1pa[sk:1] -> Bool) -> t_t2jk[sk:1] a_a1pa[sk:1] -> Bool ~# Int`
from the coercion, as well as `Foldable t_t2jk[sk:1]`. By adding a flag to
`TcSEnv` and adding a `runTcSEarlyAbort`, we can fail as soon as we hit
an insoluble constraint. Since we don't need the result in the case that it
fails, a boolean `False` (i.e. "it didn't work" from `runTcSEarlyAbort`)
is sufficient.

We also check whether the type of the hole is an immutable type variable (i.e.
a skolem). In that case, the only possible fits are fits of exactly that type,
which can only come from the locals. This speeds things up quite a bit when we
don't know anything about the type of the hole. This also helps with degenerate
fits like (`id (_ :: a)` and `head (_ :: [a])`) when looking for fits of type
`a`, where `a` is a skolem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `tcCheckHoleFit` we compare (with `tcSubTypeSigma`) the type of the hole
with the type of zillions of in-scope functions, to see which would "fit".
Most of these checks fail!  They generate obviously-insoluble constraints.
For these very-common cases we don't want to crank up the full constraint
solver.  It's much more efficient to do a quick-and-dirty check for insolubility.

Now, `tcSubTypeSigma` uses the on-the-fly unifier in GHC.Tc.Utils.Unify,
it has already done the dirt-simple unification. So our quick-and-dirty
check can simply look for constraints like (Int ~ Bool).  We don't need
to worry about (Maybe Int ~ Maybe Bool).

The quick-and-dirty check is in `checkInsoluble`. It can make a big
difference: For test hard_hole_fits, compile-time allocation goes down by 37%!
