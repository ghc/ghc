Note [topdir: How GHC finds its files]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC needs various support files (library packages, RTS etc), plus
various auxiliary programs (cp, gcc, etc).  It starts by finding topdir,
the root of GHC's support files

On Unix:
  - ghc always has a shell wrapper that passes a -B<dir> option

On Windows:
  - ghc never has a shell wrapper.
  - we can find the location of the ghc binary, which is
        $topdir/<foo>/<something>.exe
    where <something> may be "ghc", "ghc-stage2", or similar
  - we strip off the "<foo>/<something>.exe" to leave $topdir.

from topdir we can find package.conf, ghc-asm, etc.


Note [tooldir: How GHC finds mingw on Windows]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC has some custom logic on Windows for finding the mingw
toolchain. In general we will find the mingw toolchain
in $topdir/../../mingw/.

This story is long and with lots of twist and turns..  But let's talk about how
the build system finds and wires through the toolchain information.

1) It all starts in configure.ac which has two modes it operates on:
   a) The default is where `EnableDistroToolchain` is false.  This indicates
      that we want to use the in-tree bundled toolchains.  In this mode we will
      download and unpack some custom toolchains into the `inplace/mingw` folder
      and everything is pointed to that folder.
   b) The second path is when `EnableDistroToolchain` is true.  This makes the
      toolchain behave a lot like Linux, in that  the environment is queried for
      information on the tools we require.

  From configure.ac we export the standard variables to set the paths to the
  tools for the build system to use.

2) After we have the path to the tools we have to generate the right paths to
   store in the settings file for ghc to use.  This is done in aclocal.m4.
   Again we have two modes of operation:
   a) If not `EnableDistroToolchain` the paths are rewritten to paths using a
      variable `$tooldir` as we need an absolute path.  $tooldir is filled in by
      the `expandToolDir` function in this module at GHC startup.
   b) When `EnableDistroToolchain` then instead of filling in a absolute path
      we fill in just the program name.  The assumption here is that at runtime
      the environment GHC is operating on will be the same as the one configure
      was run in.  This means we expect `gcc, ld, as` etc to be on the PATH.

  From `aclocal.m4` we export a couple of variables starting with `Settings`
  which will be used to generate the settings file.

3) The next step is to generate the settings file: The file
  `cfg/system.config.in` is preprocessed by configure and the output written to
  `system.config`.  This serves the same purpose as `config.mk` but it rewrites
  the values that were exported.

  Next up is `src/Oracles/Settings.hs` which makes from some Haskell ADT to
  the settings `keys` in the `system.config`.

  The last part of this is the `generateSettings` in `src/Rules/Generate.hs`
  which produces the desired settings file out of Hadrian. This is the
  equivalent to `rts/include/ghc.mk`.

--

So why do we have these? On Windows there's no such thing as a platform compiler
and as such we need to provide GCC and binutils.  The easiest way is to bundle
these with the compiler and wire them up.  This gives you a relocatable
binball.  This works fine for most users.  However mingw-w64 have a different
requirement.  They require all packages in the repo to be compiled using the
same version of the compiler.  So it means when they are rebuilding the world to
add support for GCC X, they expect all packages to have been compiled with GCC X
which is a problem since we ship an older GCC version.

GHC is a package in mingw-w64 because there are Haskell packages in the
repository which of course requires a Haskell compiler.  To help them we
provide the override which allows GHC to instead of using an inplace compiler to
play nice with the system compiler instead.
