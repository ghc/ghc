{- Generating code for a let-no-escape binding, aka join point is very
very similar to what we do for a case expression.  The duality is
between

and

That is, the RHS of 'x' (ie 'b') will execute *later*, just like
the alternative of the case; it needs to be compiled in an environment
in which all volatile bindings are forgotten, and the free vars are
bound only to stable things like stack locations..  The 'e' part will
execute *next*, just like the scrutinee of a case. -}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- Note [Compiling case expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is quite interesting to decide whether to put a heap-check at the
start of each alternative.  Of course we certainly have to do so if
the case forces an evaluation, or if there is a primitive op which can
trigger GC.

NB: things are not settled here: see #8326.

A more interesting situation is this (a Plan-B situation)

        !P!;
        ...P...
        case x# of
          0#      -> !Q!; ...Q...
          default -> !R!; ...R...

where !x! indicates a possible heap-check point. The heap checks
in the alternatives *can* be omitted, in which case the topmost
heapcheck will take their worst case into account.

In favour of omitting !Q!, !R!:

 - *May* save a heap overflow test,
   if ...P... allocates anything.

 - We can use relative addressing from a single Hp to
   get at all the closures so allocated.

 - No need to save volatile vars etc across heap checks
   in !Q!, !R!

Against omitting !Q!, !R!

  - May put a heap-check into the inner loop.  Suppose
        the main loop is P -> R -> P -> R...
        Q is the loop exit, and only it does allocation.
    This only hurts us if P does no allocation.  If P allocates,
    then there is a heap check in the inner loop anyway.

  - May do more allocation than reqd.  This sometimes bites us
    badly.  For example, nfib (ha!) allocates about 30\% more space if the
    worst-casing is done, because many many calls to nfib are leaf calls
    which don't need to allocate anything.

    We can un-allocate, but that costs an instruction

Neither problem hurts us if there is only one alternative.

Suppose the inner loop is P->R->P->R etc.  Then here is
how many heap checks we get in the *inner loop* under various
conditions

  Alloc   Heap check in branches (!Q!, !R!)?
  P Q R      yes     no (absorb to !P!)
--------------------------------------
  n n n      0          0
  n y n      0          1
  n . y      1          1
  y . y      2          1
  y . n      1          1

Best choices: absorb heap checks from Q and R into !P! iff
  a) P itself does some allocation
or
  b) P does allocation, or there is exactly one alternative

We adopt (b) because that is more likely to put the heap check at the
entry to a function, when not many things are live.  After a bunch of
single-branch cases, we may have lots of things live

Hence: Two basic plans for

        case e of r { alts }

------ Plan A: the general case ---------

        ...save current cost centre...

        ...code for e,
           with sequel (SetLocals r)

        ...restore current cost centre...
        ...code for alts...
        ...alts do their own heap checks

   When using GcInAlts the return point for heap checks and evaluating
   the scrutinee is shared. This does mean we might execute the actual
   branching code twice but it's rare enough to not matter.
   The huge advantage of this pattern is that we do not require multiple
   info tables for returning from gc as they can be shared between all
   cases. Reducing code size nicely.

------ Plan B: special case when ---------
  (i)  e does not allocate or call GC
  (ii) either upstream code performs allocation
       or there is just one alternative

  Then heap allocation in the (single) case branch
  is absorbed by the upstream check.
  Very common example: primops on unboxed values

        ...code for e,
           with sequel (SetLocals r)...

        ...code for alts...
        ...no heap check...

   There is a variant B.2 which we use if:

  (i)   e is already evaluated+tagged
  (ii)  We have multiple alternatives
  (iii) and there is no upstream allocation.

  Here we also place one heap check before the `case` which
  branches on `e`. Hopefully to be absorbed by an already existing
  heap check further up. However the big difference in this case is that
  there is no code for e. So we are not guaranteed that the heap
  checks of the alts will be combined with an heap check further up.

  Very common example: Casing on strict fields.

        ...heap check...
        ...assign bindings...

        ...code for alts...
        ...no heap check...

  -- Reasoning for Plan B.2:
   Since the scrutinee is already evaluated there is no evaluation
   call which would force a info table that we can use as a shared
   return point.
   This means currently if we were to do GcInAlts like in Plan A then
   we would end up with one info table per alternative.

   To avoid this we unconditionally do gc outside of the alts with all
   the pros and cons described in Note [Compiling case expressions].
   Rewriting the logic to generate a shared return point before the case
   expression while keeping the heap checks in the alternatives would be
   possible. But it's unclear to me that this would actually be an improvement.

   This means if we have code along these lines:

      g x y = case x of
         True -> Left $ (y + 1,y,y-1)
         False -> Right $! y - (2 :: Int)

   We get these potential heap check placements:

   f = ...
      !max(L,R)!; -- Might be absorbed upstream.
      case x of
         True  -> !L!; ...L...
         False -> !R!; ...R...

   And we place a heap check at !max(L,R)!

   The downsides of using !max(L,R)! are:

   * If f is recursive, and the hot loop wouldn't allocate, but the exit branch does then we do
   a redundant heap check.
   * We use one more instruction to de-allocate the unused heap in the branch using less heap. (Negligible)
   * A small risk of running gc slightly more often than needed especially if one branch allocates a lot.

   The upsides are:
   * May save a heap overflow test if there is an upstream check already.
   * If the heap check is absorbed upstream we can also eliminate its info table.
   * We generate at most one heap check (versus one per alt otherwise).
   * No need to save volatile vars etc across heap checks in !L!, !R!
   * We can use relative addressing from a single Hp to get at all the closures so allocated. (seems neglible)
   * It fits neatly in the logic we already have for handling A/B

   For containers:Data/Sequence/Internal/Sorting.o the difference is
   about 10% in terms of code size compared to using Plan A for this case.
   The main downside is we might put heap checks into loops, even if we
   could avoid it (See Note [Compiling case expressions]).

   Potential improvement: Investigate if heap checks in alts would be an
   improvement if we generate and use a shared return point that is placed
   in the common path for all alts.

Note [Scrutinising VoidRep]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have this STG code:
   f = \[s : State# RealWorld] ->
       case s of _ -> blah
This is very odd.  Why are we scrutinising a state token?  But it
can arise with bizarre NOINLINE pragmas (#9964)
    crash :: IO ()
    crash = IO (\s -> let {-# NOINLINE s' #-}
                          s' = s
                      in (# s', () #))

Now the trouble is that 's' has VoidRep, and we do not bind void
arguments in the environment; they don't live anywhere.  See the
calls to nonVoidIds in various places.  So we must not look up
's' in the environment.  Instead, just evaluate the RHS!  Simple.

Note [Dead-binder optimisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider:

   case x of (y, z<dead>) -> rhs

where `z` is unused in `rhs`.  When we return form the eval of `x`,
GHC.StgToCmm.DataCon.bindConArgs will generate some loads, assuming the the
value of `x` is returned in R1:
   y := R1[1]
   z := R1[2]

If `z` is never used, the load `z := R1[2]` is a waste of a memory operation.
CmmSink (which sinks loads to their usage sites, if any) will eliminate the dead
load; but
  1. CmmSink only runs with -O
  2. It would save CmmSink work if we simply did not generate the load in the
  first place.

Hence STG uses dead-binder information, in `bindConArgs` to drop dead loads.
That's why we preserve occurrence-info on binders in GHC.Core.Tidy (see
GHC.Core.Tidy.tidyIdBndr).

So it's important that deadness is accurate.  But StgCse can invalidate it
(#14895 #24233).  Here is an example:

  map_either :: (a -> b) -> Either String a -> Either String b
  map_either = \f e -> case e of b<dead> {
    Right x -> Right (f x)
    Left  x -> Left x
  }

  The case-binder "b" is dead (not used in the rhss of the alternatives).
  StgCse notices that `Left x` doesn't need to be allocated as we can reuse `b`,
  and we get:

  map_either :: (a -> b) -> Either String a -> Either String b
  map_either = \f e -> case e of b { -- b no longer dead!
    Right x -> Right (f x)
    Left  x -> b
  }

For now StgCse simply zaps occurrence information on case binders. A more
accurate update would complexify the implementation and doesn't seem worth it.

because bottom must be untagged, it will be entered.  The Sequel is a

Note [Eliminate trivial Solo# continuations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have code like this:

    case scrut of bndr {
      alt -> Solo# bndr
    }

The RHS of the only branch does nothing except wrap the case-binder
returned by 'scrut' in a unary unboxed tuple.  But unboxed tuples
don't exist at run-time, i.e. the branch is a no-op!  So we can
generate code as if we just had 'scrut' instead of a case-expression.

This situation can easily arise for IO or ST code, where the last
operation a function performs is commonly 'pure $! someExpr'.
See also #24264 and !11778.  More concretely, as of December 2023,
when building a stage2 "perf+no_profiled_libs" ghc:

 * The special case is reached 398 times.
 * Of these, 158 have scrutinees that call a function or enter a
   potential thunk, and would need to push a useless stack frame if
   not for this optimisation.

We might consider rewriting such case expressions in GHC.Stg.CSE as a
slight extension of Note [All alternatives are the binder].  But the
RuntimeReps of 'bndr' and 'Solo# bndr' are not exactly the same, and
per Note [Typing the STG language] in GHC.Stg.Lint, we do expect Stg
code to remain RuntimeRep-correct.  So we just detect the situation in
StgToCmm instead.

Crucially, the return conventions for 'ty' and '(# ty #)' are compatible:
The returned value is passed in the same register(s) or stack slot in
both conventions, and the set of allowed return values for 'ty'
is a subset of the allowed return values for '(# ty #)':

 * For a lifted type 'ty', the return convention for 'ty' promises to
   return an evaluated-properly-tagged heap pointer, while a return
   type '(# ty #)' only promises to return a heap pointer to an object
   that can be evaluated later if need be.

 * If 'ty' is unlifted, the allowed return
   values for 'ty' and '(# ty #)' are identical.

{- Note [GC for conditionals]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For comparison operators (`is_cmp_op`) it seems that we have always done
NoGcInAlts.  It's odd, and it's flagrantly inconsistent with the rules described
Note [Compiling case expressions].  However, that's the way it has been for ages
(there was some long-gone history involving tagToEnum#; see #13397, #8317, #8326).

Note [scrut sequel]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The job of the scrutinee is to assign its value(s) to alt_regs.
Additionally, if we plan to do a heap-check in the alternatives (see
Note [Compiling case expressions]), then we *must* retreat Hp to
recover any unused heap before passing control to the sequel.  If we
don't do this, then any unused heap will become slop because the heap
check will reset the heap usage. Slop in the heap breaks LDV profiling
(+RTS -hb) which needs to do a linear sweep through the nursery.


Note [Inlining out-of-line primops and heap checks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If shouldInlinePrimOp returns True when called from GHC.StgToCmm.Expr for the
purpose of heap check placement, we *must* inline the primop later in
GHC.StgToCmm.Prim. If we don't things will go wrong.

-- Note [Double switching for big families]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- An algebraic data type can have a n >= 0 summands
-- (or alternatives), which are identified (labeled) by
-- constructors. In memory they are kept apart by tags
-- (see Note [Data constructor dynamic tags] in GHC.StgToCmm.Closure).
-- Due to the characteristics of the platform that
-- contribute to the alignment of memory objects, there
-- is a natural limit of information about constructors
-- that can be encoded in the pointer tag. When the mapping
-- of constructors to the pointer tag range 1..mAX_PTR_TAG
-- is not injective, then we have a "big data type", also
-- called a "big (constructor) family" in the literature.
-- Constructor tags residing in the info table are injective,
-- but considerably more expensive to obtain, due to additional
-- memory access(es).
--
-- When doing case analysis on a value of a "big data type"
-- we need two nested switch statements to make up for the lack
-- of injectivity of pointer tagging, also taking the info
-- table tag into account. The exact mechanism is described next.
--
-- In the general case, switching on big family alternatives
-- is done by two nested switch statements. According to
-- Note [Tagging big families], the outer switch
-- looks at the pointer tag and the inner dereferences the
-- pointer and switches on the info table tag.
--
-- We can handle a simple case first, namely when none
-- of the case alternatives mention a constructor having
-- a pointer tag of 1..mAX_PTR_TAG-1. In this case we
-- simply emit a switch on the info table tag.
-- Note that the other simple case is when all mentioned
-- alternatives lie in 1..mAX_PTR_TAG-1, in which case we can
-- switch on the ptr tag only, just like in the small family case.
--
-- There is a single intricacy with a nested switch:
-- Both should branch to the same default alternative, and as such
-- avoid duplicate codegen of potentially heavy code. The outer
-- switch generates the actual code with a prepended fresh label,
-- while the inner one only generates a jump to that label.
--
-- For example, let's assume a 64-bit architecture, so that all
-- heap objects are 8-byte aligned, and hence the address of a
-- heap object ends in `000` (three zero bits).
--
-- Then consider the following data type
--
--   > data Big = T0 | T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | T5 | T6 | T7 | T8
--   Ptr tag:      1    2    3    4    5    6    7    7    7
--   As bits:    001  010  011  100  101  110  111  111  111
--   Info pointer tag (zero based):
--                 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
--
-- Then     \case T2 -> True; T8 -> True; _ -> False
-- will result in following code (slightly cleaned-up and
-- commented -ddump-cmm-from-stg):
{-
           R1 = _sqI::P64;  -- scrutinee
           if (R1 & 7 != 0) goto cqO; else goto cqP;
       cqP: // global       -- enter
           call (I64[R1])(R1) returns to cqO, args: 8, res: 8, upd: 8;
       cqO: // global       -- already WHNF

           switch [6 .. 8] _cr2::I64 {
               case 8 : goto cr1;
               default: {goto cr0;}
           }

       cr0: // global     -- technically necessary label
           goto cqS;

-- For 32-bit systems we only have 2 tag bits in the pointers at our disposal,
-- so the performance win is dubious, especially in face of the increased code
-- size due to double switching. But we can take the viewpoint that 32-bit
-- architectures are not relevant for performance any more, so this can be
-- considered as moot.


-- Note [alg-alt heap check]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- In an algebraic case with more than one alternative, we will have
-- code like
--
-- L0:
--   x = R1
--   goto L1
-- L1:
--   if (x & 7 >= 2) then goto L2 else goto L3
-- L2:
--   Hp = Hp + 16
--   if (Hp > HpLim) then goto L4
--   ...
-- L4:
--   call gc() returns to L5
-- L5:
--   x = R1
--   goto L1


-- Note [Tagging big families]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Both the big and the small constructor families are tagged,
-- that is, greater unions which overflow the tag space of TAG_BITS
-- (i.e. 3 on 32 resp. 7 constructors on 64 bit archs).
--
-- For example, let's assume a 64-bit architecture, so that all
-- heap objects are 8-byte aligned, and hence the address of a
-- heap object ends in `000` (three zero bits).  Then consider
-- > data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
-- > data Day a = Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
-- > data Grade = G1 | G2 | G3 | G4 | G5 | G6 | G7 | G8 | G9 | G10
--
-- Since `Grade` has more than 7 constructors, it counts as a
-- "big data type" (also referred to as "big constructor family" in papers).
-- On the other hand, `Maybe` and `Day` have 7 constructors or fewer, so they
-- are "small data types".
--
-- Then
--   * A pointer to an unevaluated thunk of type `Maybe Int`, `Day` or `Grade` will end in `000`
--   * A tagged pointer to a `Nothing`, `Mon` or `G1` will end in `001`
--   * A tagged pointer to a `Just x`, `Tue` or `G2`  will end in `010`
--   * A tagged pointer to `Wed` or `G3` will end in `011`
--       ...
--   * A tagged pointer to `Sat` or `G6` will end in `110`
--   * A tagged pointer to `Sun` or `G7` or `G8` or `G9` or `G10` will end in `111`
--
-- For big families we employ a mildly clever way of combining pointer and
-- info-table tagging. We use 1..MAX_PTR_TAG-1 as pointer-resident tags where
-- the tags in the pointer and the info table are in a one-to-one
-- relation, whereas tag MAX_PTR_TAG is used as "spill over", signifying
-- we have to fall back and get the precise constructor tag from the
-- info-table.
--
-- Consequently we now cascade switches, because we have to check
-- the pointer tag first, and when it is MAX_PTR_TAG, fetch the precise
-- tag from the info table, and switch on that. The only technically
-- tricky part is that the default case needs (logical) duplication.
-- To do this we emit an extra label for it and branch to that from
-- the second switch. This avoids duplicated codegen. See #14373.
-- See Note [Double switching for big families] for the mechanics
-- involved.

-- Note [Self-recursive tail calls]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Self-recursive tail calls can be optimized into a local jump in the same
-- way as let-no-escape bindings (see Note [What is a non-escaping let] in
-- "GHC.CoreToStg"). Consider this:
--
-- foo.info:
--     a = R1  // calling convention
--     b = R2
--     goto L1
-- L1: ...
--     ...
-- ...
-- L2: R1 = x
--     R2 = y
--     call foo(R1,R2)
--
-- Instead of putting x and y into registers (or other locations required by the
-- calling convention) and performing a call we can put them into local
-- variables a and b and perform jump to L1:
--
-- foo.info:
--     a = R1
--     b = R2
--     goto L1
-- L1: ...
--     ...
-- ...
-- L2: a = x
--     b = y
--     goto L1
--
-- This can be done only when function is calling itself in a tail position
-- and only if the call passes number of parameters equal to function's arity.
-- Note that this cannot be performed if a function calls itself with a
-- continuation.
--
-- This in fact implements optimization known as "loopification". It was
-- described in "Low-level code optimizations in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler"
-- by Krzysztof Woś, though we use different approach. Krzysztof performed his
-- optimization at the Cmm level, whereas we perform ours during code generation
-- (Stg-to-Cmm pass) essentially making sure that optimized Cmm code is
-- generated in the first place.
--
-- Implementation is spread across a couple of places in the code:
--
--   * FCode monad stores additional information in its reader
--     environment (stgToCmmSelfLoop field). This `SelfLoopInfo`
--     record tells us which function can tail call itself in an
--     optimized way (it is the function currently being compiled),
--     its RepArity, what is the label of its loop header (L1 in
--     example above) and information about which local registers
--     should receive arguments when making a call (this would be a
--     and b in the example above).
--
--   * Whenever we are compiling a function, we set that information to reflect
--     the fact that function currently being compiled can be jumped to, instead
--     of called. This is done in closureCodyBody in GHC.StgToCmm.Bind.
--
--   * We also have to emit a label to which we will be jumping. We make sure
--     that the label is placed after a stack check but before the heap
--     check. The reason is that making a recursive tail-call does not increase
--     the stack so we only need to check once. But it may grow the heap, so we
--     have to repeat the heap check in every self-call. This is done in
--     do_checks in GHC.StgToCmm.Heap.
--
--   * When we begin compilation of another closure we remove the additional
--     information from the environment. This is done by forkClosureBody
--     in GHC.StgToCmm.Monad. Other functions that duplicate the environment -
--     forkLneBody, forkAlts, codeOnly - duplicate that information. In other
--     words, we only need to clean the environment of the self-loop information
--     when compiling right hand side of a closure (binding).
--
--   * When compiling a call (cgIdApp) we use getCallMethod to decide what kind
--     of call will be generated. getCallMethod decides to generate a self
--     recursive tail call when (a) environment stores information about
--     possible self tail-call; (b) that tail call is to a function currently
--     being compiled; (c) number of passed arguments is equal to
--     function's unarised arity. (d) loopification is turned on via
--     -floopification command-line option.
--
--   * Command line option to turn loopification on and off is implemented in
--     DynFlags, then passed to StgToCmmConfig for this phase.
