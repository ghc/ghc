Note [Mapping Info Tables to Source Positions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This note describes what the `-finfo-table-map` flag achieves.

When debugging memory issues it is very useful to be able to map a specific closure
to a position in the source. The prime example is being able to map a THUNK to
a specific place in the source program, the mapping is usually quite precise because
a fresh info table is created for each distinct THUNK.

The info table map is also used to generate stacktraces.
See Note [Stacktraces from Info Table Provenance Entries (IPE based stack unwinding)]
for details.

There are three parts to the implementation

1. In GHC.Stg.Debug, the SourceNote information is used in order to give a source location
   to some specific closures.
2. In GHC.Driver.GenerateCgIPEStub, the actually used info tables are collected after the
   Cmm pipeline. This is important as it's hard to predict beforehand what code generation
   will do and which ids will end up in the generated program. Additionally, info tables of
   return frames (used to create stacktraces) are generated in the Cmm pipeline and aren't
   available before.
3. During code generation, a mapping from the info table to the statically determined location
   is emitted which can then be queried at runtime by various tools.

-- Giving Source Locations to Closures

At the moment thunk and constructor closures are added to the map. This information
is collected in the `InfoTableProvMap` which provides a mapping from:

1. Data constructors to a list of where they are used.
2. `Name`s and where they originate from.
3. Stack represented info tables (return frames) to an approximated source location
   of the call that pushed a continuation on the stacks.

During the CoreToStg phase, this map is populated whenever something is turned into
a StgRhsClosure or an StgConApp. The current source position is recorded
depending on the location indicated by the surrounding SourceNote.

The functions which add information to the map are `recordStgIdPosition` and
`numberDataCon`.

When the `-fdistinct-constructor-tables` flag is turned on then every
usage of a data constructor gets its own distinct info table. This is orchestrated
in `collectExpr` where an incrementing number is used to distinguish each
occurrence of a data constructor.

-- GenerateCgIPEStub

The info tables which are actually used in the generated program are collected after
the Cmm pipeline. `initInfoTableProv` is used to create a CStub, that initializes the
map in C code.

This step has to be done after the Cmm pipeline to make sure that all info tables are
really used and, even more importantly, return frame info tables are generated by the
pipeline.

-- Code Generation

The output of these two phases is combined together during code generation.
A C stub is generated which creates the static map from info table pointer to the
information about where that info table was created from. This is created by
`ipInitCode` in the same manner as a C stub is generated for cost centres.

This information can be consumed in two ways.

1. The complete mapping is emitted into the eventlog so that external tools such
as eventlog2html can use the information with the heap profile by info table mode.
2. The `lookupIPE` function can be used via the `whereFrom#` primop to introspect
information about a closure in a running Haskell program.

Note [Distinct Info Tables for Constructors]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the old times, each usage of a data constructor used the same info table.
This made it impossible to distinguish which actual usage of a data constructor was
contributing primarily to the allocation in a program. Using the `-fdistinct-constructor-tables` flag you
can cause code generation to generate a distinct info table for each usage of
a constructor. Then, when inspecting the heap you can see precisely which usage of a constructor
was responsible for each allocation.
