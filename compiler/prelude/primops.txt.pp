-- This file is processed by the utility program genprimopcode to produce
-- a number of include files within the compiler and optionally to produce
-- human-readable documentation.
--
-- It should first be preprocessed.
--
-- Information on how PrimOps are implemented and the steps necessary to
-- add a new one can be found in the Commentary:
--
--  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/commentary/prim-ops
--
-- Note in particular that Haskell block-style comments are not recognized
-- here, so stick to '--' (even for Notes spanning multiple lines).

-- This file is divided into named sections, each containing or more
-- primop entries. Section headers have the format:
--
--      section "section-name" {description}
--
-- This information is used solely when producing documentation; it is
-- otherwise ignored.  The description is optional.
--
-- The format of each primop entry is as follows:
--
--      primop internal-name "name-in-program-text" category type {description} attributes

-- The default attribute values which apply if you don't specify
-- other ones.  Attribute values can be True, False, or arbitrary
-- text between curly brackets.  This is a kludge to enable
-- processors of this file to easily get hold of simple info
-- (eg, out_of_line), whilst avoiding parsing complex expressions
-- needed for strictness info.
--
-- type refers to the general category of the primop. Valid settings include,
--
--  * Compare:   A comparison operation of the shape a -> a -> Int#
--  * Monadic:   A unary operation of shape a -> a
--  * Dyadic:    A binary operation of shape a -> a -> a
--  * GenPrimOp: Any other sort of primop
--

-- The vector attribute is rather special. It takes a list of 3-tuples, each of
-- which is of the form <ELEM_TYPE,SCALAR_TYPE,LENGTH>. ELEM_TYPE is the type of
-- the elements in the vector; LENGTH is the length of the vector; and
-- SCALAR_TYPE is the scalar type used to inject to/project from vector
-- element. Note that ELEM_TYPE and SCALAR_TYPE are not the same; for example,
-- to broadcast a scalar value to a vector whose elements are of type Int8, we
-- use an Int#.

-- When a primtype or primop has a vector attribute, it is instantiated at each
-- 3-tuple in the list of 3-tuples. That is, the vector attribute allows us to
-- define a family of types or primops. Vector support also adds three new
-- keywords: VECTOR, SCALAR, and VECTUPLE. These keywords are expanded to types
-- derived from the 3-tuple. For the 3-tuple <Int64,INT64,2>, VECTOR expands to
-- Int64X2#, SCALAR expands to INT64, and VECTUPLE expands to (# INT64, INT64
-- #).

-- Note [When do out-of-line primops go in primops.txt.pp]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Out of line primops are those with a C-- implementation. But that
-- doesn't mean they *just* have an C-- implementation. As mentioned in
-- Note [Inlining out-of-line primops and heap checks], some out-of-line
-- primops also have additional internal implementations under certain
-- conditions. Now that `foreign import prim` exists, only those primops
-- which have both internal and external implementations ought to be
-- this file. The rest aren't really primops, since they don't need
-- bespoke compiler support but just a general way to interface with
-- C--. They are just foreign calls.
--
-- Unfortunately, for the time being most of the primops which should be
-- moved according to the previous paragraph can't yet. There are some
-- superficial restrictions in `foreign import prim` which mus be fixed
-- first. Specifically, `foreign import prim` always requires:
--
--   - No polymorphism in type
--   - `strictness       = <default>`
--   - `can_fail         = False`
--   - `has_side_effects = True`
--
-- https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/16929 tracks this issue,
-- and has a table of which external-only primops are blocked by which
-- of these. Hopefully those restrictions are relaxed so the rest of
-- those can be moved over.
--
-- 'module GHC.Prim.Ext is a temporarily "holding ground" for primops
-- that were formally in here, until they can be given a better home.
-- Likewise, their underlying C-- implementation need not live in the
-- RTS either. Best case (in my view), both the C-- and `foreign import
-- prim` can be moved to a small library tailured to the features being
-- implemented and dependencies of those features.

-- Currently, documentation is produced using latex, so contents of
-- description fields should be legal latex. Descriptions can contain
-- matched pairs of embedded curly brackets.

#include "MachDeps.h"

section "The word size story."
        {Haskell98 specifies that signed integers (type {\tt Int})
         must contain at least 30 bits. GHC always implements {\tt
         Int} using the primitive type {\tt Int\#}, whose size equals
         the {\tt MachDeps.h} constant {\tt WORD\_SIZE\_IN\_BITS}.
         This is normally set based on the {\tt config.h} parameter
         {\tt SIZEOF\_HSWORD}, i.e., 32 bits on 32-bit machines, 64
         bits on 64-bit machines.  However, it can also be explicitly
         set to a smaller number than 64, e.g., 62 bits, to allow the
         possibility of using tag bits. Currently GHC itself has only
         32-bit and 64-bit variants, but 61, 62, or 63-bit code can be
         exported as an external core file for use in other back ends.
         30 and 31-bit code is no longer supported.

         GHC also implements a primitive unsigned integer type {\tt
         Word\#} which always has the same number of bits as {\tt
         Int\#}.

         In addition, GHC supports families of explicit-sized integers
         and words at 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, with the usual
         arithmetic operations, comparisons, and a range of
         conversions.  The 8-bit and 16-bit sizes are always
         represented as {\tt Int\#} and {\tt Word\#}, and the
         operations implemented in terms of the primops on these
         types, with suitable range restrictions on the results (using
         the {\tt narrow$n$Int\#} and {\tt narrow$n$Word\#} families
         of primops.  The 32-bit sizes are represented using {\tt
         Int\#} and {\tt Word\#} when {\tt WORD\_SIZE\_IN\_BITS}
         $\geq$ 32; otherwise, these are represented using distinct
         primitive types {\tt Int32\#} and {\tt Word32\#}. These (when
         needed) have a complete set of corresponding operations;
         however, nearly all of these are implemented as external C
         functions rather than as primops.  Exactly the same story
         applies to the 64-bit sizes.  All of these details are hidden
         under the {\tt PrelInt} and {\tt PrelWord} modules, which use
         {\tt \#if}-defs to invoke the appropriate types and
         operators.

         Word size also matters for the families of primops for
         indexing/reading/writing fixed-size quantities at offsets
         from an array base, address, or foreign pointer.  Here, a
         slightly different approach is taken.  The names of these
         primops are fixed, but their {\it types} vary according to
         the value of {\tt WORD\_SIZE\_IN\_BITS}. For example, if word
         size is at least 32 bits then an operator like
         \texttt{indexInt32Array\#} has type {\tt ByteArray\# -> Int\#
         -> Int\#}; otherwise it has type {\tt ByteArray\# -> Int\# ->
         Int32\#}.  This approach confines the necessary {\tt
         \#if}-defs to this file; no conditional compilation is needed
         in the files that expose these primops.

         Finally, there are strongly deprecated primops for coercing
         between {\tt Addr\#}, the primitive type of machine
         addresses, and {\tt Int\#}.  These are pretty bogus anyway,
         but will work on existing 32-bit and 64-bit GHC targets; they
         are completely bogus when tag bits are used in {\tt Int\#},
         so are not available in this case.  }

    On a 64-bit platform it is not always possible to

section "Small Arrays"

        {Operations on {\tt SmallArray\#}. A {\tt SmallArray\#} works
         just like an {\tt Array\#}, but with different space use and
         performance characteristics (that are often useful with small
         arrays). The {\tt SmallArray\#} and {\tt SmallMutableArray#}
         lack a `card table'. The purpose of a card table is to avoid
         having to scan every element of the array on each GC by
         keeping track of which elements have changed since the last GC
         and only scanning those that have changed. So the consequence
         of there being no card table is that the representation is
         somewhat smaller and the writes are somewhat faster (because
         the card table does not need to be updated). The disadvantage
         of course is that for a {\tt SmallMutableArray#} the whole
         array has to be scanned on each GC. Thus it is best suited for
         use cases where the mutable array is not long lived, e.g.
         where a mutable array is initialised quickly and then frozen
         to become an immutable {\tt SmallArray\#}.

-- Note [Why MutVar# ops can't fail]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- We don't label readMutVar# or writeMutVar# as can_fail.
-- This may seem a bit peculiar, because they surely *could*
-- fail spectacularly if passed a pointer to unallocated memory.
-- But MutVar#s are always correct by construction; we never
-- test if a pointer is valid before using it with these operations.
-- So we never have to worry about floating the pointer reference
-- outside a validity test. At the moment, has_side_effects blocks
-- up the relevant optimizations anyway, but we hope to draw finer
-- distinctions soon, which should improve matters for readMutVar#
-- at least.

--
--   MutVar# s a -> (a -> (# a, b #)) -> State# s -> (# State# s, a, (# a, b #) #)
--
-- The reason is that atomicModifyMutVar2# relies on laziness for its atomicity.
-- Given a MutVar# containing x, atomicModifyMutVar2# merely replaces
-- its contents with a thunk of the form (fst (f x)). This can be done using an
-- atomic compare-and-swap as it is merely replacing a pointer.

-- Note [reallyUnsafePtrEquality#]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality# can't actually fail, per se, but we mark it can_fail
-- anyway. Until 5a9a1738023a, GHC considered primops okay for speculation only
-- when their arguments were known to be forced. This was unnecessarily
-- conservative, but it prevented reallyUnsafePtrEquality# from floating out of
-- places where its arguments were known to be forced. Unfortunately, GHC could
-- sometimes lose track of whether those arguments were forced, leading to let/app
-- invariant failures (see #13027 and the discussion in #11444). Now that
-- ok_for_speculation skips over lifted arguments, we need to explicitly prevent
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality# from floating out. Imagine if we had
--
--     \x y . case x of x'
--              DEFAULT ->
--            case y of y'
--              DEFAULT ->
--               let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x' y'
--               in ...
--
-- If the let floats out, we'll get
--
--     \x y . let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x y
--            in case x of ...
--
-- The trouble is that pointer equality between thunks is very different
-- from pointer equality between the values those thunks reduce to, and the latter
-- is typically much more precise.

pseudoop   "unsafeCoerce#"
   a -> b
   { The function {\tt unsafeCoerce\#} allows you to side-step the typechecker entirely. That
        is, it allows you to coerce any type into any other type. If you use this function,
        you had better get it right, otherwise segmentation faults await. It is generally
        used when you want to write a program that you know is well-typed, but where Haskell's
        type system is not expressive enough to prove that it is well typed.

        The following uses of {\tt unsafeCoerce\#} are supposed to work (i.e. not lead to
        spurious compile-time or run-time crashes):

         * Casting any lifted type to {\tt Any}

         * Casting {\tt Any} back to the real type

         * Casting an unboxed type to another unboxed type of the same size.
           (Casting between floating-point and integral types does not work.
           See the {\tt GHC.Float} module for functions to do work.)

         * Casting between two types that have the same runtime representation.  One case is when
           the two types differ only in "phantom" type parameters, for example
           {\tt Ptr Int} to {\tt Ptr Float}, or {\tt [Int]} to {\tt [Float]} when the list is
           known to be empty.  Also, a {\tt newtype} of a type {\tt T} has the same representation
           at runtime as {\tt T}.

        Other uses of {\tt unsafeCoerce\#} are undefined.  In particular, you should not use
        {\tt unsafeCoerce\#} to cast a T to an algebraic data type D, unless T is also
        an algebraic data type.  For example, do not cast {\tt Int->Int} to {\tt Bool}, even if
        you later cast that {\tt Bool} back to {\tt Int->Int} before applying it.  The reasons
        have to do with GHC's internal representation details (for the cognoscenti, data values
        can be entered but function closures cannot).  If you want a safe type to cast things
        to, use {\tt Any}, which is not an algebraic data type.

     This function is runtime-representation polymorphic, but the
     {\tt RuntimeRep} type argument is marked as {\tt Inferred}, meaning
     that it is not available for visible type application. This means
     the typechecker will accept {\tt coerce @Int @Age 42}.

section "Prefetch"
        {Prefetch operations: Note how every prefetch operation has a name
  with the pattern prefetch*N#, where N is either 0,1,2, or 3.

  This suffix number, N, is the "locality level" of the prefetch, following the
  convention in GCC and other compilers.
  Higher locality numbers correspond to the memory being loaded in more
  levels of the cpu cache, and being retained after initial use. The naming
  convention follows the naming convention of the prefetch intrinsic found
  in the GCC and Clang C compilers.

  On the LLVM backend, prefetch*N# uses the LLVM prefetch intrinsic
  with locality level N. The code generated by LLVM is target architecture
  dependent, but should agree with the GHC NCG on x86 systems.

  On the Sparc and PPC native backends, prefetch*N is a No-Op.

  On the x86 NCG, N=0 will generate prefetchNTA,
  N=1 generates prefetcht2, N=2 generates prefetcht1, and
  N=3 generates prefetcht0.

  For streaming workloads, the prefetch*0 operations are recommended.
  For workloads which do many reads or writes to a memory location in a short period of time,
  prefetch*3 operations are recommended.

  For further reading about prefetch and associated systems performance optimization,
  the instruction set and optimization manuals by Intel and other CPU vendors are
  excellent starting place.


  The "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual" is
  especially a helpful read, even if your software is meant for other CPU
  architectures or vendor hardware. The manual can be found at
  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.html .

  The {\tt prefetch*} family of operations has the order of operations
  determined by passing around the {\tt State#} token.

  To get a "pure" version of these operations, use {\tt inlinePerformIO} which is quite safe in this context.

  It is important to note that while the prefetch operations will never change the
  answer to a pure computation, They CAN change the memory locations resident
  in a CPU cache and that may change the performance and timing characteristics
  of an application. The prefetch operations are marked has_side_effects=True
  to reflect that these operations have side effects with respect to the runtime
  performance characteristics of the resulting code. Additionally, if the prefetchValue
  operations did not have this attribute, GHC does a float out transformation that
  results in a let/app violation, at least with the current design.
