-- Note [When to lift]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- $when
-- The analysis proceeds in two steps:
--
--   1. It tags the syntax tree with analysis information in the form of
--      'BinderInfo' at each binder and 'Skeleton's at each let-binding
--      by 'tagSkeletonTopBind' and friends.
--   2. The resulting syntax tree is treated by the "StgLiftLams.Transformation"
--      module, calling out to 'goodToLift' to decide if a binding is worthwhile
--      to lift.
--      'goodToLift' consults argument occurrence information in 'BinderInfo'
--      and estimates 'closureGrowth', for which it needs the 'Skeleton'.
--
-- So the annotations from 'tagSkeletonTopBind' ultimately fuel 'goodToLift',
-- which employs a number of heuristics to identify and exclude lambda lifting
-- opportunities deemed non-beneficial:
--
--  [Top-level bindings] can't be lifted.
--  [Thunks] and data constructors shouldn't be lifted in order not to destroy
--    sharing.
--  [Argument occurrences] #arg_occs# of binders prohibit them to be lifted.
--    Doing the lift would re-introduce the very allocation at call sites that
--    we tried to get rid off in the first place. We capture analysis
--    information in 'BinderInfo'. Note that we also consider a nullary
--    application as argument occurrence, because it would turn into an n-ary
--    partial application created by a generic apply function. This occurs in
--    CPS-heavy code like the CS benchmark.
--  [Join points] should not be lifted, simply because there's no reduction in
--    allocation to be had.
--  [Abstracting over join points] destroys join points, because they end up as
--    arguments to the lifted function.
--  [Abstracting over known local functions] turns a known call into an unknown
--    call (e.g. some @stg_ap_*@), which is generally slower. Can be turned off
--    with @-fstg-lift-lams-known@.
--  [Calling convention] Don't lift when the resulting function would have a
--    higher arity than available argument registers for the calling convention.
--    Can be influenced with @-fstg-lift-(non)rec-args(-any)@.
--  [Closure growth] introduced when former free variables have to be available
--    at call sites may actually lead to an increase in overall allocations
--  resulting from a lift. Estimating closure growth is described in
--  "StgLiftLams.Analysis#clogro" and is what most of this module is ultimately
--  concerned with.
--
-- There's a <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/LateLamLift wiki page> with
-- some more background and history.

-- Note [Estimating closure growth]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- $clogro
-- We estimate closure growth by abstracting the syntax tree into a 'Skeleton',
-- capturing only syntactic details relevant to 'closureGrowth', such as
--
--   * 'ClosureSk', representing closure allocation.
--   * 'RhsSk', representing a RHS of a binding and how many times it's called
--     by an appropriate 'DmdShell'.
--   * 'AltSk', 'BothSk' and 'NilSk' for choice, sequence and empty element.
--
-- This abstraction is mostly so that the main analysis function 'closureGrowth'
-- can stay simple and focused. Also, skeletons tend to be much smaller than
-- the syntax tree they abstract, so it makes sense to construct them once and
-- and operate on them instead of the actual syntax tree.
--
-- A more detailed treatment of computing closure growth, including examples,
-- can be found in the paper referenced from the
-- <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/LateLamLift wiki page>.
