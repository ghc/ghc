-- Note [Handling floats]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- $floats
-- Consider the following expression:
--
-- @
--     f x =
--       let g y = ... f y ...
--       in g x
-- @
--
-- What happens when we want to lift @g@? Normally, we'd put the lifted @l_g@
-- binding above the binding for @f@:
--
-- @
--     g f y = ... f y ...
--     f x = g f x
-- @
--
-- But this very unnecessarily turns a known call to @f@ into an unknown one, in
-- addition to complicating matters for the analysis.
-- Instead, we'd really like to put both functions in the same recursive group,
-- thereby preserving the known call:
--
-- @
--     Rec {
--       g y = ... f y ...
--       f x = g x
--     }
-- @
--
-- But we don't want this to happen for just /any/ binding. That would create
-- possibly huge recursive groups in the process, calling for an occurrence
-- analyser on STG.
-- So, we need to track when we lift a binding out of a recursive RHS and add
-- the binding to the same recursive group as the enclosing recursive binding
-- (which must have either already been at the top-level or decided to be
-- lifted itself in order to preserve the known call).
--
-- This is done by expressing this kind of nesting structure as a 'Writer' over
-- @['FloatLang']@ and flattening this expression in 'runLiftM' by a call to
-- 'collectFloats'.
-- API-wise, the analysis will not need to know about the whole 'FloatLang'
-- business and will just manipulate it indirectly through actions in 'LiftM'.

-- | We need to detect when we are lifting something out of the RHS of a
-- recursive binding (c.f. "StgLiftLams.LiftM#floats"), in which case that
-- binding needs to be added to the same top-level recursive group. This
-- requires we detect a certain nesting structure, which is encoded by
-- 'StartBindingGroup' and 'EndBindingGroup'.
--
-- Although 'collectFloats' will only ever care if the current binding to be
-- lifted (through 'LiftedBinding') will occur inside such a binding group or
-- not, e.g. doesn't care about the nesting level as long as its greater than 0.
