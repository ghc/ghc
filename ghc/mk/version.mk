#
# Project-specific version information.
#
# Note:
#   this config file is intended to centralise all
#   project version information. To bump up the version
#   info on your package, edit this file and recompile
#   all the dependents. This file lives in the source tree.
#
# In the case of the ghc/ project, if you make changes
# to this file, you'll *have to* to rebuild the driver
# in your build tree(s). The ghc/driver/Makefile has got
# a dependency that will force such rebuilding to happen,
# but it does require you to do a 'make' in ghc/driver.

#
# Ghc project settings:
# 
# ProjectVersion    is treated as a *string*
# ProjectVersionInt is treated as an *integer* (for cpp defines)

# Versioning scheme: A.BB.C
#         A: major version, any number of digits
#         B: minor version, two digits padded with leading zeros
#	  C: patchlevel, one digit, omitted if zero.
#
# ProjectVersionInt does *not* contain the patchlevel (rationale: this
# figure is used for conditional compilations, and library interfaces
# etc. are not supposed to change between patchlevels).
#
# The ProjectVersionInt is included in interface files, and GHC
# checks that it's reading interface generated by the same ProjectVersion
# as itself. It does this even though interface file syntax may not 
# change between versions.  Rationale: calling conventions or other 
# random .o-file stuff might change even if the .hi syntax doesn't

# Interface file version (hi-boot files only)
#
# A GHC built with HscIfaceFileVersion=n will look for 
#	M.hi-boot-n, and only then for 
#	M.hi-boot.
# (It'll be happy with the latter if the former doesn't exist.)
#
#
# This variable is used ONLY for hi-boot files.  Its only purpose is
# to allow you to have a single directory with multiple .hi-boot files
# for the same module, each corresponding to a different version of
# GHC.
#
# HscIfaceFileVersion is propagated to hsc via
# ghc/compiler/main/Config.hs, which is automatically generated by
# ghc/compiler/Makefile.
