   ============================================================
    The (Interactive) Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 5.04
   ============================================================

We are pleased to announce a new major release of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC), version 5.04.

Highlights include:

  * Hierarchical libraries, with documentation produced by Haddock.

  * New type system extensions: full rank-N types and kind
    annotations.
 
  * New heap profiling facilities (retainer profiling, biographical
    profiling).

  * MacOS X support

See the release notes for a full list of the changes:

How to get it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easy way is to go to the WWW page, which should be self-explanatory:

        http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for various
flavours of Linux and BSD, and in Windows Installer (MSI) form
for Windows folks.  Binary builds for other platforms are available
as a .tar.gz which can be installed wherever you want.  The source
distribution is also available from the same place.

Packages will appear as they are built - if the package for your
system isn't available yet, please try again later.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language; the
current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating good code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces (C, whatever).  GHC is distributed under a
BSD-style open source license.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page (see below).


On-line GHC-related resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compile programs with GHC, you need a machine with 64+MB memory, GCC
and perl. This release is known to work on the following platforms:

  * i386-unknown-{linux,*bsd,mingw32}
  * sparc-sun-solaris2
  * alpha-dec-osf3
  * powerpc-apple-darwin (MacOS/X)

Ports to the following platforms should be relatively easy (for a
wunderhacker), but haven't been tested due to lack of time/hardware:

  * hppa1.1-hp-hpux{9,10}
  * i386-unknown-solaris2
  * mips-sgi-irix{5,6}
  * {rs6000,powerpc}-ibm-aix

The builder's guide on the web site gives a complete run-down of what
ports work; it can be found at
