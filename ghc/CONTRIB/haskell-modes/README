I've collected all the Haskell modes for GNU Emacs that I could lay my
hands on -- there are billions.  A list is attached, grouped by
"family".

I don't like "mode junk" myself, so I don't use any of them.  I will
include advertising or testimonials from happy users if they send them
along...

=======================================================================

* "Chalmers Haskell mode family" -- "Major mode for editing Haskell",
  by Lars Bo Nielsen and Lennart Augustsson.

  chalmers/original -- the original -- version 0.1.

  chalmers/thiemann -- Peter Thiemann added "indentation stuff"
	and fontification -- version 0.2.

  chalmers/sof -- Sigbjorn Finne's <sof@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk> hacked
	version of Thiemann's.

.......................................................................

* "Glasgow Haskell mode family" -- originally written by Richard McPhee
  et al., at Glasgow University, as a student project, for Kevin
  Hammond.

  glasgow/original : version 1.0, now maintained by
	gem@minster.york.ac.uk

.......................................................................

* "Simon Marlow Haskell mode family" -- This is the one that comes
  with GHC, versions 0.16 up to at least 0.26.

  simonm/real : the real thing

  simonm/ghc : the one distributed with GHC 0.16-0.26; no particular
	reason to prefer this one...

.......................................................................

* "Yale Haskell mode family" -- Especially good for chatting to a
  Yale-Haskell inferior process :-)

  yale/original : the real thing

  yale/chak : "extended by Manuel M.T. Chakravarty with rudimentary
	editing features (including better syntax table) and support
	for the font-lock-mode."  Via Hans Wolfgang Loidl
