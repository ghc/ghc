This is version 0.26 of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell compilation
system (GHC).  This is a major public release.  The top-level file
"ANNOUNCE-0.26" says more.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language [see
SIGPLAN Notices, May 1992]. Some general merits of GHC are given at
the end of this file.

Documentation of interest:

* docs/install_guide/installing.{dvi,info,html}: How to configure,
  build, and install the system.

  The document, as with many others, is in TeX-produced DVI format
  (.dvi suffix), or GNU Info format (.info); the latter is close to
  plain ASCII, if that's what you want.

* docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}: How to use GHC; e.g., what
  options are available, how to cope with common problems, how to use
  the profiling facilities, etc.

* docs/release_notes/release{dvi,info,html}: Release notes for this
  release (and all previous releases).

* docs/README: About the other documentation in this release.

We welcome your comments and suggestions about this software!  Please
do not suffer or grumble in silence.  The "bug reports" section of the
User's Guide (docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}) says what we
would like to know when you report a problem.
