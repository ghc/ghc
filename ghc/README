This is version 2.10 of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell compilation
system (GHC).  GHC 2.10 is a compiler for Haskell 1.4.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
Haskell 1.4 is the current version of the language, released in
May. 1996.  The language definition is on the Web at
http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/haskell-report/haskell-report.html

GHC documentation of interest:

* docs/installing.{dvi,info,html}: How to configure, build, and
  install the system.

  The document, as with many others, is in TeX-produced DVI format
  (.dvi suffix), or GNU Info format (.info); the latter is close to
  plain ASCII, if that's what you want.

* ghc/docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}: How to use GHC; e.g., what
  options are available, how to cope with common problems, how to use
  the profiling facilities, etc.

* ghc/docs/users_guide/release.{dvi,info,html}: Release notes for this
  release (and earlier releases).

* ghc/docs/README: About the other documentation in this release.

We welcome your comments and suggestions about this software!  Please
do not suffer or grumble in silence.  The "bug reports" section of the
User's Guide (docs/users_guide/user.{dvi,info,html}) says what we
would like to know when you report a problem.
