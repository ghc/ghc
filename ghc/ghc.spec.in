%description
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System (GHC) is a robust,
fully-featured, optimising compiler for the functional programming
language Haskell 98.  GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or
C. It implements numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell,
including concurrency, a foreign language interface, several
type-system extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a
generational garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a
comprehensive set of libraries.  This package includes HTML and PS
versions of the SGML-based documentation for GHC.  They are also available 
online at http://www.haskell.org/ghc/.

Haskell 98 is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
More info plus the language definition is at http://www.haskell.org/.

Profiling libraries for Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System (GHC).
They should be installed when GHC's profiling subsystem is needed.

%changelog

* Thu Jun 22 2000 Sven Panne
- removed explicit usage of hslibs/docs, it belongs to ghc/docs/set

* Sun Apr 23 2000 Manuel Chakravarty
- revised for ghc 4.07; added suggestions from Pixel <pixel@mandrakesoft.com>
- added profiling package

* Tue Dec 7 1999 Manuel Chakravarty
- version for use from CVS

* Thu Sep 16 1999 Manuel Chakravarty
- modified for GHC 4.04, patchlevel 1 (no more 62 tuple stuff); minimises use
  of patch files - instead emits a build.mk on-the-fly

* Sat Jul 31 1999 Manuel Chakravarty
- modified for GHC 4.04

* Wed Jun 30 1999 Manuel Chakravarty
- some more improvements from vbzoli

* Fri Feb 26 1999 Manuel Chakravarty
- modified for GHC 4.02

* Thu Dec 24 1998 Zoltan Vorosbaranyi 
- added BuildRoot
- files located in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib moved to /usr/bin, /usr/lib

* Tue Jul 28 1998 Manuel Chakravarty
- original version

# generate the file list for lib/ _excluding_ all files needed for profiling
# only
#
# * generating file lists in a BUILD_ROOT spec is a bit tricky: the file list
#   has to contain complete paths, _but_ without the BUILD_ROOT, we also do
#   _not_ want have directory names in the list; furthermore, we have to make
#   sure that any leading / is removed from %{prefix}/lib, as find has to 
#   interpret the argument as a relative path; however, we have to include the
#   leading / again in the final file list (otherwise, rpm complains)
# * isn't there an easier way to do all this?
