Hugs and GHC provide a common set of libraries to aid portability.
This document specifies the interfaces to these libraries and documents
known differences.  We hope that these modules will be adopted for inclusion
as Standard Haskell Libraries sometime soon.

<toc>

<sect> <idx/ST/ 
<label id="sec:ST">
<p>

This library provides support for <em/strict/ state threads, as
described in the PLDI '94 paper by John Launchbury and Simon Peyton
Jones <cite id="LazyStateThreads">.  In addition to the monad <tt/ST/,
it also provides mutable variables <tt/STRef/ and mutable arrays
<tt/STArray/.

<tscreen><verb>
module ST( module ST, module Monad ) where
import Monad

data ST s a        -- abstract type
runST              :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -> a
fixST              :: (a -> ST s a) -> ST s a
unsafeInterleaveST :: ST s a -> ST s a
instance Functor (ST s)
instance Monad   (ST s)

data STRef s a     -- mutable variables in state thread s
                   -- containing values of type a.
newSTRef           :: a -> ST s (STRef s a)
readSTRef          :: STRef s a -> ST s a
writeSTRef         :: STRef s a -> a -> ST s ()
instance Eq (STRef s a)

data STArray s ix elt -- mutable arrays in state thread s
                      -- indexed by values of type ix
                      -- containing values of type a.
newSTArray          :: Ix ix => (ix,ix) -> elt -> ST s (STArray s ix elt)
boundsSTArray       :: Ix ix => STArray s ix elt -> (ix, ix)
readSTArray         :: Ix ix => STArray s ix elt -> ix -> ST s elt
writeSTArray        :: Ix ix => STArray s ix elt -> ix -> elt -> ST s ()
thawSTArray         :: Ix ix => Array ix elt -> ST s (STArray s ix elt)
freezeSTArray       :: Ix ix => STArray s ix elt -> ST s (Array ix elt)
unsafeFreezeSTArray :: Ix ix => STArray s ix elt -> ST s (Array ix elt)  
instance Eq (STArray s ix elt)
</verb></tscreen>

Notes:
<itemize>

<item> 
GHC also supports ByteArrays --- these aren't supported by Hugs yet.

<item> 
The operations <tt/freezeSTArray/ and <tt/thawSTArray/ convert mutable
arrays to and from immutable arrays.  Semantically, they are identical
to copying the array and they are usually implemented that way.  The
operation <tt/unsafeFreezeSTArray/ is a faster version of
<tt/freezeSTArray/ which omits the copying step.  It's a safe substitute for
<tt/freezeSTArray/ if you don't modify the mutable array after freezing it.

<item>
In the current version of Hugs, the <tt/<idx/runST// operation,
used to specify encapsulation, is implemented as a language construct,
and <tt/runST/ is treated as a keyword.  We plan to change this to match
GHC soon.

<!-- 
  <item>
     Note that it is possible to install Hugs 1.4 without support for lazy
     state threads, and hence the primitives described here may not be
     available in all implementations.  Also, in contrast with the
     implementation of lazy state threads in previous releases of Hugs and
     Gofer, there is no direct relationship between the
     <tt/<idx/ST monad// and the <tt/<idx/IO monad//.
  -->

<item>
Hugs provides <tt/thenLazyST/ and <tt/thenStrictST/ so that you can
import <tt/LazyST/ (say) and still use the strict instance in those
places where it matters.  GHC implements LazyST and ST using different
types, so this isn't possible.
</item>

</itemize>

<sect> <idx/LazyST/ 
<label id="sec:LazyST">
<p>

This library is identical to <tt/ST/ except that the <tt/ST/ monad
instance is <em/lazy/.  The lazy ST monad tends to be more prone to
space leaks than the strict version, so most programmers will use the
former unless laziness is explicitly required.  <tt/LazyST/ provides
two additional operations:

<tscreen> <verb>
lazyToStrictST :: LazyST.ST s a -> ST.ST s a
strictToLazyST :: ST.ST s a -> LazyST.ST s a
</verb> </tscreen>

These are used to convert between lazy and strict state threads.  The
semantics with respect to laziness are as you would expect: the strict
state thread passed to <tt/strictToLazyST/ is not performed until the
result of the lazy state thread it returns is demanded.

<sect> <idx/IOExts/
<label id="sec:IOExts">
<p>

This library provides the following extensions to the IO monad:
<itemize>
<item>
The operations <tt/fixIO/, <tt/unsafePerformIO/ and <tt/unsafeInterleaveIO/
described in <cite id="ImperativeFP">

<item>
References (aka mutable variables) and mutable arrays (but no form of 
mutable byte arrays)

<item>
<tt/performGC/ triggers an immediate garbage collection

<item>
When called, <tt/trace/ prints the string in its first argument, and then
returns the second argument as its result.  The <tt/trace/ function is not
referentially transparent, and should only be used for debugging, or for
monitoring execution. 

<!--
  You should also be warned that, unless you understand some of the
  details about the way that Haskell programs are executed, results
  obtained using <tt/trace/ can be rather confusing.  For example, the
  messages may not appear in the order that you expect.  Even ignoring the
  output that they produce, adding calls to <tt/trace/ can change the
  semantics of your program.  Consider this a warning!
  -->

<item>
<tt/unsafePtrEq/ compares two values for pointer equality without
evaluating them.  The results are not referentially transparent and
may vary significantly from one compiler to another or in the face of
semantics-preserving program changes.  However, pointer equality is useful
in creating a number of referentially transparent constructs such as this
simplified memoisation function:

<tscreen><verb>
> cache :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b)
> cache f = \x -> unsafePerformIO (check x)
>  where
>   ref = unsafePerformIO (newIORef (error "cache", error "cache"))
>   check x = readIORef ref >>= \ (x',a) ->
>	       if x `unsafePtrEq` x' then
>		 return a
>	       else
>		 let a = f x in
>		 writeIORef ref (x, a) >>
>		 return a
</verb></tscreen>


</itemize>

<tscreen><verb>
module IOExts where

fixIO               :: (a -> IO a) -> IO a
unsafePerformIO     :: IO a -> a
unsafeInterleaveIO  :: IO a -> IO a
		    
data IORef a        -- mutable variables containing values of type a
newIORef     	    :: a -> IO (IORef a)
readIORef    	    :: IORef a -> IO a
writeIORef   	    :: IORef a -> a -> IO ()
instance Eq (IORef a)

                    -- containing values of type a.

boundsIOArray       :: Ix ix => IOArray ix elt -> (ix, ix)
readIOArray         :: Ix ix => IOArray ix elt -> ix -> IO elt
writeIOArray        :: Ix ix => IOArray ix elt -> ix -> elt -> IO ()

trace               :: String -> a -> a

<!--
  <sect> <idx/GlaExts/ <p>
  
  This library provides a convenient bundle of most of the extensions
  available in GHC and Hugs.  This module is generally more stable than
  the other modules of non-standard extensions so you might choose to 
  import them from here rather than going straight to the horses mouth.
  
  <tscreen><verb>
  module GlaExts( module GlaExts, module IOExts, module ST, module Addr ) where
  import IOExts
  import ST
  import Addr
  trace              :: String -> a -> a
  performGC          :: IO ()
  </verb></tscreen>
  
  The GHC version also provides the types <tt/PrimIO/, <tt/RealWorld/,
  <tt/ByteArray/, <tt/Lift/ and operations on these types. It also
  provides the unboxed views of the types
  <tt/Int/, 
  <tt/Addr/, 
  <tt/Word/, 
  <tt/Float/, 
  <tt/Double/, 
  <tt/Integer/ and
  <tt/Char/ 
  and a number of ``primitive operations'' (<tt/+&num/,
  <tt/plusFloat&num/, etc.).
  
  -->

<sect> <idx/Bits/
<label id="sec:Bits">
<p>

This library defines bitwise operations for signed and unsigned ints.

<tscreen><verb>
module Bits where
infixl 8 `shift`, `rotate`
infixl 7 .&.
infixl 6 `xor`
infixl 5 .|.

class Bits a where
  (.&.), (.|.), xor :: a -> a -> a
  complement        :: a -> a
  shift             :: a -> Int -> a
  rotate            :: a -> Int -> a
  bit               :: Int -> a        
  setBit            :: a -> Int -> a   
  clearBit          :: a -> Int -> a   
  complementBit     :: a -> Int -> a   
  testBit           :: a -> Int -> Bool
  bitSize           :: a -> Int
  isSigned          :: a -> Bool

shiftL, shiftR   :: Bits a => a -> Int -> a
rotateL, rotateR :: Bits a => a -> Int -> a
shiftL  a i = shift  a i
shiftR  a i = shift  a (-i)
rotateL a i = rotate a i
rotateR a i = rotate a (-i)
</verb></tscreen>

Notes:
<itemize>
<item>
  <tt/bitSize/ and <tt/isSigned/ are like <tt/floatRadix/ and <tt/floatDigits/
  -- they return parameters of the <em/type/ of their argument rather than 
  of the particular argument they are applied to.  <tt/bitSize/ returns
  the number of bits in the type (or <tt/Nothing/ for unbounded types); and
  <tt/isSigned/ returns whether the type is signed or not.  
<item>
  <tt/shift/ performs sign extension.  
  That is, right shifts fill the top bits with 1 if the  number is negative
  and with 0 otherwise.
  (Since unsigned types are always positive, the top bit is always filled with
  0.)
<item> 
  Bits are numbered from 0 with bit 0 being the least significant bit.
<item>
  <tt/shift x i/ and <tt/rotate x i/ shift to the left if <tt/i/ is
  positive and to the right otherwise.  
<!--
  <item>
    <tt/rotate/ is well defined only if bitSize returns a number.
    (Maybe we should impose a Bounded constraint on it?)
  -->
<item>
  <tt/bit i/ is the value with the i'th bit set.
</itemize>

<sect> <idx/Word/
<label id="sec:Word">
<p>

This library provides unsigned integers of various sizes.
The types supported are as follows:

<tabular ca="ll">
type    | number of bits @
<hline> 
Word8    | 8  @
Word16   | 16 @
Word32   | 32 @
Word64   | 64 @
<hline> 
</tabular>

For each type <it/W/ above, we provide the following functions and
instances.  The type <it/I/ refers to the signed integer type of the
same size.

<tscreen><verb>
data W            -- Unsigned Ints
instance Eq       W
instance Ord      W
instance Show     W
instance Read     W
instance Bounded  W
instance Num      W
instance Real     W
instance Integral W
instance Enum     W
instance Ix       W
instance Bits     W
</verb></tscreen>
Plus
<tscreen><verb>
word8ToWord32  :: Word8  -> Word32
word32ToWord8  :: Word32 -> Word8
word16ToWord32 :: Word16 -> Word32
word32ToWord16 :: Word32 -> Word16

word8ToInt     :: Word8  -> Int
intToWord8     :: Int    -> Word8
word16ToInt    :: Word16 -> Int
intToWord16    :: Int    -> Word16
word32ToInt    :: Word32 -> Int
intToWord32    :: Int    -> Word32
</verb></tscreen>

Notes: 
<itemize>
<item>
  All arithmetic is performed modulo 2^n

  One non-obvious consequequence of this is that <tt/negate/
  should <em/not/ raise an error on negative arguments.

<item>
The coercion <tt/wToI/ converts an unsigned n-bit value to the
signed n-bit value with the same representation.  For example,
<tt/word8ToInt8 0xff = -1/. 
Likewise, <tt/iToW/ converts signed n-bit values to the
corresponding unsigned n-bit value.

<item>
ToDo: complete the set of coercion functions.

<item>
Use <tt/Prelude.fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b/ to
coerce between different sizes or to preserve sign when converting
between values of the same size.

<item>
It would be very natural to add a type a type <tt/Natural/ providing
an unbounded size unsigned integer --- just as <tt/Integer/ provides
unbounded size signed integers.  We do not do that yet since there is
no demand for it.  Doing so would require <tt/Bits.bitSize/ to return
<tt/Maybe Int/.

<item>
The <tt/Enum/ instances stop when they reach their upper or lower
bound --- they don't overflow the way the <tt/Int/ and <tt/Float/
instances do.

<item>
It would be useful to provide a function (or a family of functions?)
which coerced between any two Word types (without going through
Integer).

</itemize>

Hugs only provides <tt/Eq/, <tt/Ord/, <tt/Read/ and <tt/Show/
instances for <tt/Word64/ at the moment.

Hugs provides <tt/Addr/ and <tt/nullAddr/ but does not provide any of
the index, read or write functions.  They can be implemented using 
GreenCard if required.

<sect> <idx/ForeignObj/
<label id="sec:ForeignObj">

This module is provided by GHC but not by Hugs.
GreenCard for Hugs provides the <tt/ForeignObj/ type.

Notes:
<itemize>

<item> 
  GHC uses preemptive multitasking:
  Context switches can occur at any time, except if you call a C
  function (like \verb"getchar") that blocks waiting for input.

  Hugs uses cooperative multitasking:
  Context switches only occur when you use one of the primitives
  defined in this module.  This means that programs such as:

<tscreen><verb>
main = forkIO (write 'a') >> write 'b'
 where write c = putChar c >> write c
</verb></tscreen>

  will print either <tt/aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.../ or <tt/bbbbbbbbbbbb.../,
  instead of some random interleaving of <tt/a/s and <tt/b/s.

  In practice, cooperative multitasking is sufficient for writing 
  simple graphical user interfaces.

<item>
Hugs does not provide the functions <tt/mergeIO/ or <tt/nmergeIO/ since these
require preemptive multitasking.

<item>
Thread identities and <tt/killThread/ has not been implemented yet on
either system. The plan is that <tt/killThread/ will raise an IO
exception in the killed thread which it can catch --- perhaps allowing -->
--it to kill its children before exiting.

<item>
The <tt/Ord/ instance for <tt/ThreadId/s provides an arbitrary total ordering
which might be used to build an ordered binary tree, say.
