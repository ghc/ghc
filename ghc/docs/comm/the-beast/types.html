    <h1>The GHC Commentary - Hybrid Types</h1>
    <p>
      GHC essentially supports two type systems: (1) the <em>source type
	system</em> (which is a heavily extended version of the type system of
      Haskell 98) and (2) the <em>Core type system,</em> which is the type system
      used by the intermediate language (see also <a
      href="desugar.html">Sugar Free: From Haskell To Core</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      During parsing and renaming, type information is represented in a form
      that is very close to Haskell's concrete syntax; it is defined by
      <code>HsTypes.HsType</code>.  In addition, type, class, and instance
      declarations are maintained in their source form as defined in the
      module <code>HsDecl</code>.  The situation changes during type checking,
      where types are translated into a second representation, which is
      defined in the module <code>types/TypeRep.lhs</code>, as type
      <code>Type</code>.  This second representation is peculiar in that it is
      a hybrid between the source representation of types and the Core
      representation of types.  Using functions, such as
      <code>Type.coreView</code> and <code>Type.deepCoreView</code>, a value
      of type <code>Type</code> exhibits its Core representation.  On the
      other hand, pretty printing a <code>Type</code> with
      <code>TypeRep.pprType</code> yields the type's source representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the <a href="typecheck.html">type checker</a> maintains type
      environments based on <code>Type</code>, but needs to perform type
      checking on source-level types.  As a result, we have functions
      <code>Type.tcEqType</code> and <code>Type.tcCmpType</code>, which
      compare types based on their source representation, as well as the
      function <code>coreEqType</code>, which compares them based on their
      core representation.  The latter is needed during type checking of Core
      (as performed by the functions in the module
      <code>coreSyn/CoreLint.lhs</code>). 
    </p>

    <h2>Type Synonyms</h2>
    <p>
      Type synonyms in Haskell are essentially a form of macro definitions on
      the type level.  For example, when the type checker compares two type
      terms, synonyms are always compared in their expanded form.  However, to
      produce good error messages, we like to avoid expanding type synonyms
      during pretty printing.  Hence, <code>Type</code> has a variant
      <code>NoteTy TyNote Type</code>, where
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
data TyNote
  = FTVNote TyVarSet	-- The free type variables of the noted expression

  | SynNote Type	-- Used for type synonyms
			-- The Type is always a TyConApp, and is the un-expanded form.
			-- The type to which the note is attached is the expanded form.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In other words, a <code>NoteTy</code> represents the expanded form of a
      type synonym together with a note stating its source form.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating Representation Types of Synonyms</h3>
    <p>
      During translation from <code>HsType</code> to <code>Type</code> the
      function <code>Type.mkSynTy</code> is used to construct representations
      of applications of type synonyms.  It creates a <code>NoteTy</code> node
      if the synonym is applied to a sufficient number of arguments;
      otherwise, it builds a simple <code>TyConApp</code> and leaves it to
      <code>TcMType.checkValidType</code> to pick up invalid unsaturated
      synonym applications.  While creating a <code>NoteTy</code>,
      <code>mkSynTy</code> also expands the synonym by substituting the type
      arguments for the parameters of the synonym definition, using
      <code>Type.substTyWith</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <code>mkSynTy</code> is used indirectly via
      <code>mkGenTyConApp</code>, <code>mkAppTy</code>, and
      <code>mkAppTy</code>, which construct type representations involving
      type applications.  The function <code>mkSynTy</code> is also used
      directly during type checking interface files; this is for tedious
      reasons to do with forall hoisting - see the comment at
      <code>TcIface.mkIfTcApp</code>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Newtypes</h2>
    <p>
      Data types declared by a <code>newtype</code> declarationx constitute new
      type constructors---i.e., they are not just type macros, but introduce
      new type names.  However, provided that a newtype is not recursive, we
      still want to implement it by its representation type.  GHC realises this
      by providing two flavours of type equality: (1) <code>tcEqType</code> is
      source-level type equality, which compares newtypes and
      <code>PredType</code>s by name, and (2) <code>coreEqType</code> compares
      them structurally (by using <code>deepCoreView</code> to expand the
      representation before comparing).  The function
      <code>deepCoreView</code> (via <code>coreView</code>) invokes
      <code>expandNewTcApp</code> for every type constructor application
      (<code>TyConApp</code>) to determine whether we are looking at a newtype
      application that needs to be expanded to its representation type.
    </p>

    <h2>Predicates</h2>
    <p>
      The dictionary translation of type classes, translates each predicate in
      a type context of a type signature into an additional argument, which
      carries a dictionary with the functions overloaded by the corresponding
      class.  The <code>Type</code> data type has a special variant
      <code>PredTy PredType</code> for predicates, where
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
data PredType 
  = ClassP Class [Type]		-- Class predicate
  | IParam (IPName Name) Type	-- Implicit parameter</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      These types need to be handled as source type during type checking, but
      turn into their representations when inspected through
      <code>coreView</code>.  The representation is determined by
      <code>Type.predTypeRep</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Representation of Type Constructors</h2>
    <p>
      Type constructor applications are represented in <code>Type</code> by
      the variant <code>TyConApp :: TyCon -> [Type] -> Type</code>.  The first
      argument to <code>TyConApp</code>, namely <code>TyCon.TyCon</code>,
      distinguishes between function type constructors (variant
      <code>FunTyCon</code>) and algebraic type constructors (variant
      <code>AlgTyCon</code>), which arise from data and newtype declarations.
      The variant <code>AlgTyCon</code> contains all the information contained
      from the data/newtype declaration as well as derived information, such
      as the <code>Unique</code> and argument variance information.  This
      includes a field <code>algTcRhs :: AlgTyConRhs</code>, where
      <code>AlgTyConRhs</code> distinguishes three kinds of algebraic data
      type declarations: (1) declarations that have been exported abstractly,
      (2) <code>data</code> declarations, and (3) <code>newtype</code>
      declarations.  The last of these both include their original right hand
      side as well as the "ultimate" representation type, which is the right
      hand side after expanding all type synonyms and non-recursive newtypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both data and newtype declarations refer to their data constructors
      represented as <code>DataCon.DataCon</code>, which include all details
      of their signature (as derived from the original declaration) as well
      information for code generation, such as their tag value.
    </p>

    <h2>Representation of Classes and Instances</h2>
    <p>
      Class declarations turn into values of type <code>Class.Class</code>.
      They represent methods as the <code>Id</code>s of the dictionary
      selector functions.  Similar selector functions are available for
      superclass dictionaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instance declarations turn into values of type
      <code>InstEnv.Instance</code>, which in interface files are represented
      as <code>IfaceSyn.IfaceInst</code>.  Moreover, the type
      <code>InstEnv.InstEnv</code>, which is a synonym for <code>UniqFM
      ClsInstEnv</code>, provides a mapping of classes to their instances -
      <code>ClsInstEnv</code> is essentially a list of instance declarations.
