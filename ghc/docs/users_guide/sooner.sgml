<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Don't use <Option>-O</Option> or (especially) <Option>-O2</Option>:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
By using them, you are telling GHC that you are willing to suffer
longer compilation times for better-quality code.
</Para>

<Para>
GHC is surprisingly zippy for normal compilations without <Option>-O</Option>!
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Use more memory:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Within reason, more memory for heap space means less garbage
collection for GHC, which means less compilation time.  If you use
the <Option>-Rgc-stats</Option> option, you'll get a garbage-collector report.
(Again, you can use the cheap-and-nasty <Option>-optCrts-Sstderr</Option> option to
send the GC stats straight to standard error.)
</Para>

<Para>
If it says you're using more than 20&percnt; of total time in garbage
collecting, then more memory would help.
</Para>

<Para>
If the heap size is approaching the maximum (64M by default), and you
have lots of memory, try increasing the maximum with the
<Option>-M&lt;size&gt;</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-M&lt;size&gt; option</Primary></IndexTerm> option, e.g.: <Command>ghc -c -O
-M1024m Foo.hs</Command>.
</Para>

<Para>
Increasing the default allocation area size used by the compiler's RTS
might also help: use the <Option>-A&lt;size&gt;</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-A&lt;size&gt; option</Primary></IndexTerm>
option.
</Para>

<Para>
If GHC persists in being a bad memory citizen, please report it as a
bug.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Don't use too much memory!</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
As soon as GHC plus its &ldquo;fellow citizens&rdquo; (other processes on your
machine) start using more than the <Emphasis>real memory</Emphasis> on your
machine, and the machine starts &ldquo;thrashing,&rdquo; <Emphasis>the party is
over</Emphasis>.  Compile times will be worse than terrible!  Use something
like the csh-builtin <Command>time</Command> command to get a report on how many page
faults you're getting.
</Para>

<Para>
If you don't know what virtual memory, thrashing, and page faults are,
or you don't know the memory configuration of your machine,
<Emphasis>don't</Emphasis> try to be clever about memory use: you'll just make
your life a misery (and for other people, too, probably).
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Try to use local disks when linking:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Because Haskell objects and libraries tend to be large, it can take
many real seconds to slurp the bits to/from a remote filesystem.
</Para>

<Para>
It would be quite sensible to <Emphasis>compile</Emphasis> on a fast machine using
remotely-mounted disks; then <Emphasis>link</Emphasis> on a slow machine that had
your disks directly mounted.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Don't derive/use <Function>Read</Function> unnecessarily:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
It's ugly and slow.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>GHC compiles some program constructs slowly:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Deeply-nested list comprehensions seem to be one such; in the past,
very large constant tables were bad, too.
</Para>

<Para>
We'd rather you reported such behaviour as a bug, so that we can try
to correct it.
</Para>

<Para>
The parts of the compiler that seem most prone to wandering off for a
long time are the abstract interpreters (strictness and update
analysers).  You can turn these off individually with
<Option>-fno-strictness</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-fno-strictness anti-option</Primary></IndexTerm> and
<Option>-fno-update-analysis</Option>.<IndexTerm><Primary>-fno-update-analysis anti-option</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
To figure out which part of the compiler is badly behaved, the
<Option>-dshow-passes</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-dshow-passes option</Primary></IndexTerm> option is your
friend.
</Para>

<Para>
If your module has big wads of constant data, GHC may produce a huge
basic block that will cause the native-code generator's register
allocator to founder.  Bring on <Option>-fvia-C</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-fvia-C option</Primary></IndexTerm>
(not that GCC will be that quick about it, either).
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Avoid the consistency-check on linking:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Use <Option>-no-link-chk</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-no-link-chk</Primary></IndexTerm>; saves effort.  This is
probably safe in a I-only-compile-things-one-way setup.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Explicit <Literal>import</Literal> declarations:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Instead of saying <Literal>import Foo</Literal>, say <Literal>import Foo (...stuff I want...)</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
Truthfully, the reduction on compilation time will be very small.
However, judicious use of <Literal>import</Literal> declarations can make a
program easier to understand, so it may be a good idea anyway.

<Sect1 id="faster">
<Title>Faster: producing a program that runs quicker
</Title>

<Para>
<IndexTerm><Primary>faster programs, how to produce</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
The key tool to use in making your Haskell program run faster are
GHC's profiling facilities, described separately in <XRef LinkEnd="profiling">.  There is <Emphasis>no substitute</Emphasis> for
finding where your program's time/space is <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> going, as
opposed to where you imagine it is going.
</Para>

<Para>
Another point to bear in mind: By far the best way to improve a
program's performance <Emphasis>dramatically</Emphasis> is to use better
algorithms.  Once profiling has thrown the spotlight on the guilty
time-consumer(s), it may be better to re-think your program than to
try all the tweaks listed below.
</Para>

<Para>
Another extremely efficient way to make your program snappy is to use
library code that has been Seriously Tuned By Someone Else.  You
<Emphasis>might</Emphasis> be able to write a better quicksort than the one in the
HBC library, but it will take you much longer than typing <Literal>import
QSort</Literal>.  (Incidentally, it doesn't hurt if the Someone Else is Lennart
Augustsson.)
</Para>

<Para>
Please report any overly-slow GHC-compiled programs.  The current
definition of &ldquo;overly-slow&rdquo; is &ldquo;the HBC-compiled version ran
faster&rdquo;&hellip;
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Optimise, using <Option>-O</Option> or <Option>-O2</Option>:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This is the most basic way
to make your program go faster.  Compilation time will be slower,
especially with <Option>-O2</Option>.
</Para>

<Para>
At present, <Option>-O2</Option> is nearly indistinguishable from <Option>-O</Option>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Compile via C and crank up GCC:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Even with <Option>-O</Option>, GHC tries to
use a native-code generator, if available.  But the native
code-generator is designed to be quick, not mind-bogglingly clever.
Better to let GCC have a go, as it tries much harder on register
allocation, etc.
</Para>

<Para>
So, when we want very fast code, we use: <Option>-O -fvia-C -O2-for-C</Option>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Overloaded functions are not your friend:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Haskell's overloading (using type classes) is elegant, neat, etc.,
etc., but it is death to performance if left to linger in an inner
loop.  How can you squash it?
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Give explicit type signatures:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Signatures are the basic trick; putting them on exported, top-level
functions is good software-engineering practice, anyway.  (Tip: using
<Option>-fwarn-missing-signatures</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-fwarn-missing-signatures
option</Primary></IndexTerm> can help enforce good signature-practice).
</Para>

<Para>
The automatic specialisation of overloaded functions (with <Option>-O</Option>)
should take care of overloaded local and/or unexported functions.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Use <Literal>SPECIALIZE</Literal> pragmas:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
<IndexTerm><Primary>SPECIALIZE pragma</Primary></IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm><Primary>overloading, death to</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
Specialize the overloading on key functions in your program.  See
<XRef LinkEnd="specialize-pragma"> and
<XRef LinkEnd="specialize-instance-pragma">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>&ldquo;But how do I know where overloading is creeping in?&rdquo;:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
A low-tech way: grep (search) your interface files for overloaded
type signatures; e.g.,:

<ProgramListing>
% egrep '^[a-z].*::.*=&#62;' *.hi
</ProgramListing>

</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Strict functions are your dear friends:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
and, among other things, lazy pattern-matching is your enemy.
</Para>

<Para>
(If you don't know what a &ldquo;strict function&rdquo; is, please consult a
functional-programming textbook.  A sentence or two of
explanation here probably would not do much good.)
</Para>

<Para>
Consider these two code fragments:

<ProgramListing>
f (Wibble x y) =  ... # strict

f arg = let { (Wibble x y) = arg } in ... # lazy
</ProgramListing>

The former will result in far better code.
</Para>

<Para>
A less contrived example shows the use of <Literal>cases</Literal> instead
of <Literal>lets</Literal> to get stricter code (a good thing):

<ProgramListing>
f (Wibble x y)  # beautiful but slow
  = let
        (a1, b1, c1) = unpackFoo x
        (a2, b2, c2) = unpackFoo y
    in ...

f (Wibble x y)  # ugly, and proud of it
  = case (unpackFoo x) of { (a1, b1, c1) -&#62;
    case (unpackFoo y) of { (a2, b2, c2) -&#62;
    ...
    }}
</ProgramListing>

</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>GHC loves single-constructor data-types:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
It's all the better if a function is strict in a single-constructor
type (a type with only one data-constructor; for example, tuples are
single-constructor types).
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Newtypes are better than datatypes:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If your datatype has a single constructor with a single field, use a
<Literal>newtype</Literal> declaration instead of a <Literal>data</Literal> declaration.  The <Literal>newtype</Literal>
will be optimised away in most cases.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>&ldquo;How do I find out a function's strictness?&rdquo;</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Don't guess&mdash;look it up.
</Para>

<Para>
Look for your function in the interface file, then for the third field
in the pragma; it should say <Literal>&lowbar;S&lowbar; &lt;string&gt;</Literal>.  The <Literal>&lt;string&gt;</Literal>
gives the strictness of the function's arguments.  <Function>L</Function> is lazy
(bad), <Function>S</Function> and <Function>E</Function> are strict (good), <Function>P</Function> is &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; (good),
<Function>U(...)</Function> is strict and
&ldquo;unpackable&rdquo; (very good), and <Function>A</Function> is absent (very good).
</Para>

<Para>
For an &ldquo;unpackable&rdquo; <Function>U(...)</Function> argument, the info inside
tells the strictness of its components.  So, if the argument is a
pair, and it says <Function>U(AU(LSS))</Function>, that means &ldquo;the first component of the
pair isn't used; the second component is itself unpackable, with three
components (lazy in the first, strict in the second \&#38; third).&rdquo;
</Para>

<Para>
If the function isn't exported, just compile with the extra flag <Option>-ddump-simpl</Option>;
next to the signature for any binder, it will print the self-same
pragmatic information as would be put in an interface file.
(Besides, Core syntax is fun to look at!)
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Force key functions to be <Literal>INLINE</Literal>d (esp. monads):</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Placing <Literal>INLINE</Literal> pragmas on certain functions that are used a lot can
have a dramatic effect.  See <XRef LinkEnd="inline-pragma">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Explicit <Literal>export</Literal> list:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If you do not have an explicit export list in a module, GHC must
assume that everything in that module will be exported.  This has
various pessimising effects.  For example, if a bit of code is actually
<Emphasis>unused</Emphasis> (perhaps because of unfolding effects), GHC will not be
able to throw it away, because it is exported and some other module
may be relying on its existence.
</Para>

<Para>
GHC can be quite a bit more aggressive with pieces of code if it knows
they are not exported.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Look at the Core syntax!</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
(The form in which GHC manipulates your code.)  Just run your
compilation with <Option>-ddump-simpl</Option> (don't forget the <Option>-O</Option>).
</Para>

<Para>
If profiling has pointed the finger at particular functions, look at
their Core code.  <Literal>lets</Literal> are bad, <Literal>cases</Literal> are good, dictionaries
(<Literal>d.&lt;Class&gt;.&lt;Unique&gt;</Literal>) &lsqb;or anything overloading-ish&rsqb; are bad,
nested lambdas are bad, explicit data constructors are good, primitive
operations (e.g., <Literal>eqInt&num;</Literal>) are good,&hellip;
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Use unboxed types (a GHC extension):</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
When you are <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> desperate for speed, and you want to get
right down to the &ldquo;raw bits.&rdquo;  Please see <XRef LinkEnd="glasgow-unboxed"> for some information about using unboxed
types.

<ListItem>
<Para>
This may take real work, but&hellip; There exist piles of
massively-tuned library code, and the best thing is not
to compete with it, but link with it.
</Para>

<Para>

</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Don't use <Literal>Float</Literal>s:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
We don't provide specialisations of Prelude functions for <Literal>Float</Literal>
(but we do for <Literal>Double</Literal>).  If you end up executing overloaded
code, you will lose on performance, perhaps badly.
</Para>

<Para>
<Literal>Floats</Literal> (probably 32-bits) are almost always a bad idea, anyway,
unless you Really Know What You Are Doing.  Use Doubles.  There's
rarely a speed disadvantage&mdash;modern machines will use the same
floating-point unit for both.  With <Literal>Doubles</Literal>, you are much less
likely to hang yourself with numerical errors.
</Para>

<Para>
One time when <Literal>Float</Literal> might be a good idea is if you have a
<Emphasis>lot</Emphasis> of them, say a giant array of <Literal>Float</Literal>s.  They take up
half the space in the heap compared to <Literal>Doubles</Literal>.  However, this isn't
true on a 64-bit machine.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Use a bigger heap!</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If your program's GC stats (<Option>-S</Option><IndexTerm><Primary>-S RTS option</Primary></IndexTerm> RTS option)
indicate that it's doing lots of garbage-collection (say, more than
20&percnt; of execution time), more memory might help&mdash;with the
