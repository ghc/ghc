<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>``Help! The compiler crashed (or `panic'd)!''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
These events are <Emphasis>always</Emphasis> bugs in the GHC system&mdash;please report them.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``The compiler ran out of heap (or stack) when compiling itself!''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
It happens.  We try to supply reasonable <Literal>-H&lt;n&gt;</Literal> flags for
<Literal>ghc/compiler/</Literal> and <Literal>ghc/lib/</Literal>, but GHC's memory consumption
can vary by platform (e.g., on a 64-bit machine).
</Para>

<Para>
Just say <Literal>make all EXTRA&lowbar;HC&lowbar;OPTS=-H&lt;a reasonable number&gt;</Literal> and see
how you get along.
</Para>

<Para>
Note that this is less likely to happen if you are compiling with GHC
4.00 or later, since the introduction of the dynamically expanding
heap.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``The compiler died with a pattern-matching error.''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This is a bug just as surely as a ``panic.'' Please report it.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``This is a terrible error message.''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If you think that GHC could have produced a better error message,
please report it as a bug.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``What about these `trace' messages from GHC?''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Almost surely not a problem.  About some specific cases&hellip;
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>Simplifier still going after N iterations:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Sad, but harmless.  You can change the number with a
<Literal>-fmax-simplifier-iterations&lt;N&gt;</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>-fmax-simplifier-iterations&lt;N&gt; option</Primary></IndexTerm> option (no space);
and you can see what actions took place in each iteration by
turning on the <Literal>-fshow-simplifier-progress</Literal>
<IndexTerm><Primary>-fshow-simplifier-progress option</Primary></IndexTerm> option.
</Para>

<Para>
If the simplifier definitely seems to be ``looping,'' please report
it.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
</VariableList>
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``What about this warning from the C compiler?''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
For example: ``&hellip;warning: `Foo' declared `static' but never defined.''
Unsightly, but shouldn't be a problem.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>Sensitivity to <Literal>.hi</Literal> interface files:</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
GHC is very sensitive about interface files.  For example, if it picks
up a non-standard <Literal>Prelude.hi</Literal> file, pretty terrible things will
happen.  If you turn on
<Literal>-fno-implicit-prelude</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>-fno-implicit-prelude option</Primary></IndexTerm>, the
compiler will almost surely die, unless you know what you are doing.
</Para>

<Para>
Furthermore, as sketched below, you may have big problems
running programs compiled using unstable interfaces.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``I think GHC is producing incorrect code'':</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
Unlikely :-) A useful be-more-paranoid option to give to GHC is
<Literal>-dcore-lint</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>-dcore-lint option</Primary></IndexTerm>; this causes a ``lint''
pass to check for errors (notably type errors) after each Core-to-Core
transformation pass.  We run with <Literal>-dcore-lint</Literal> on all the time; it
costs about 5&percnt; in compile time.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``Why did I get a link error?''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
If the linker complains about not finding <Literal>&lowbar;&lt;something&gt;&lowbar;fast</Literal>, then
something is inconsistent: you probably didn't compile modules in the
proper dependency order.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``What's a `consistency error'?''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
(These are reported just after linking your program.)
</Para>

<Para>
You tried to link incompatible object files, e.g., normal ones
(registerised, Appel garbage-collector) with profiling ones (two-space
collector).  Or those compiled by a previous version of GHC
with an incompatible newer version.
</Para>

<Para>
If you run <Literal>nm -o *.o &verbar; egrep 't (cc&verbar;hsc)\.'</Literal> (or, on
unregisterised files: <Literal>what *.o</Literal>), you'll see all the consistency
tags/strings in your object files.  They must all be the same!
(ToDo: tell you what they mean&hellip;)
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``Is this line number right?''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
On this score, GHC usually does pretty well, especially
if you ``allow'' it to be off by one or two.  In the case of an
instance or class declaration, the line number
may only point you to the declaration, not to a specific method.
</Para>

<Para>
Please report line-number errors that you find particularly unhelpful.

<IndexTerm><Primary>problems running your program</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
(For advice about overly slow or memory-hungry Haskell programs,
please see <XRef LinkEnd="sooner-faster-quicker">).
</Para>

<Para>
<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term>``Help! My program crashed!''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
(e.g., a `segmentation fault' or `core dumped')
<IndexTerm><Primary>segmentation fault</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>

<Para>
If your program has no <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal>s/<Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal>s in it, then a crash is
always a BUG in the GHC system, except in one case: If your program is
made of several modules, each module must have been compiled after any
modules on which it depends (unless you use <Literal>.hi-boot</Literal> files, in which
case these <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> be correct with respect to the module source). 
</Para>

<Para>
For example, if an interface is lying about the type of an imported
value then GHC may well generate duff code for the importing module.
<Emphasis>This applies to pragmas inside interfaces too!</Emphasis>  If the pragma is
lying (e.g., about the ``arity'' of a value), then duff code may result.
Furthermore, arities may change even if types do not.
</Para>

<Para>
In short, if you compile a module and its interface changes, then all
the modules that import that interface <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> be re-compiled.
</Para>

<Para>
A useful option to alert you when interfaces change is
<Literal>-hi-diffs</Literal><IndexTerm><Primary>-hi-diffs option</Primary></IndexTerm>.  It will run <Literal>diff</Literal> on the
changed interface file, before and after, when applicable.
</Para>

<Para>
If you are using <Literal>make</Literal>, a useful tool to make sure that every module
<Emphasis>is</Emphasis> up-to-date with respect to its imported interfaces is
<Literal>mkdependHS</Literal> (which comes with GHC).  Please see <XRef LinkEnd="mkdependHS">.
</Para>

<Para>
If you are down to your last-compile-before-a-bug-report, we would
recommend that you add a <Literal>-dcore-lint</Literal> option (for extra checking) to your compilation options.
</Para>

<Para>
So, before you report a bug because of a core dump, you should probably:

<Screen>
% rm *.o        # scrub your object files
% make my_prog  # re-make your program; use -hi-diffs to highlight changes;
                # as mentioned above, use -dcore-lint to be more paranoid
% ./my_prog ... # retry...
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Of course, if you have <Literal>&lowbar;ccall&lowbar;</Literal>s/<Literal>&lowbar;casm&lowbar;</Literal>s in your program then all
bets are off, because you can trash the heap, the stack, or whatever.
</Para>

<Para>

GHC-compiled program, please see <XRef LinkEnd="hard-core-debug">.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``My program entered an `absent' argument.''</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This is definitely caused by a bug in GHC. Please report it.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>
<VarListEntry>
<Term>``What's with this `arithmetic (or `floating') exception' ''?</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
<Literal>Int</Literal>, <Literal>Float</Literal>, and <Literal>Double</Literal> arithmetic is <Emphasis>unchecked</Emphasis>.
Overflows, underflows and loss of precision are either silent or
reported as an exception by the operating system (depending on the
architecture).  Divide-by-zero <Emphasis>may</Emphasis> cause an untrapped
exception (please report it if it does).

If your program is crashing, you should almost surely file a bug
report, as outlined in previous sections.
</Para>

<Para>
This section suggests ways to Make Further Progress Anyway.
</Para>

<Para>
The first thing to establish is: Is it a garbage-collection (GC) bug?
Try your program with a very large heap and a <Literal>-Sstderr</Literal> RTS
flag.

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
If it crashes <Emphasis>without</Emphasis> garbage-collecting, then it is
definitely <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> a GC bug.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
If you can make it crash with one heap size but not with another, then
it <Emphasis>probably is</Emphasis> a GC bug.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
If it crashes with the normal
collector, but not when you force two-space collection (<Literal>-F2s</Literal>
runtime flag), then it <Emphasis>probably is</Emphasis> a GC bug.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
If it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> a GC bug, you may be able to avoid it by using a
particular heap size or by using a <Literal>-F2s</Literal> runtime flag.  (But don't
forget to report the bug!!!)
