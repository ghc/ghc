  <Para> Glasgow Haskell comes with a time and space profiling
  system. Its purpose is to help you improve your understanding of
  your program's execution behaviour, so you can improve it.</Para>
  
  <Para> Any comments, suggestions and/or improvements you have are
  welcome.  Recommended &ldquo;profiling tricks&rdquo; would be
  especially cool! </Para>

  <para>Profiling a program is a three-step process:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para> Re-compile your program for profiling with the
      <literal>-prof</literal> option, and probably one of the
      <literal>-auto</literal> or <literal>-auto-all</literal>
      options.  These options are described in more detail in <xref
      linkend="prof-compiler-options"> </para>

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para> Run your program with one of the profiling options
      <literal>-p</literal> or <literal>-h</literal>.  This generates
      a file of profiling information.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para> Examine the generated profiling information, using one of
      GHC's profiling tools.  The tool to use will depend on the kind
      of profiling information generated.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Cost centres and cost-centre stacks</title>
    
    <para>GHC's profiling system assigns <firstterm>costs</firstterm>
    to <firstterm>cost centres</firstterm>.  A cost is simply the time
    or space required to evaluate an expression.  Cost centres are
    program annotations around expressions; all costs incurred by the
    annotated expression are assigned to the enclosing cost centre.
    Furthermore, GHC will remember the stack of enclosing cost centres
    for any given expression at run-time and generate a call-graph of
    cost attributions.</para>

    <para>Let's take a look at an example:</para>

    <programlisting>
main = print (nfib 25)
nfib n = if n < 2 then 1 else nfib (n-1) + nfib (n-2)
</programlisting>

    <para>Compile and run this program as follows:</para>

    <screen>
$ ghc -prof -auto-all -o Main Main.hs
$ ./Main +RTS -p
121393
$
</screen>

    <para>When a GHC-compiled program is run with the
    <option>-p</option> RTS option, it generates a file called
    <filename>&lt;prog&gt;.prof</filename>.  In this case, the file
    will contain something like this:</para>

</screen>


    <para>The first part of the file gives the program name and
    options, and the total time and total memory allocation measured
    during the run of the program (note that the total memory
    allocation figure isn't the same as the amount of
    <emphasis>live</emphasis> memory needed by the program at any one
    time; the latter can be determined using heap profiling, which we
    will describe shortly).</para>

    <para>The second part of the file is a break-down by cost centre
    of the most costly functions in the program.  In this case, there
    was only one significant function in the program, namely
    <function>nfib</function>, and it was responsible for 100&percnt;
    of both the time and allocation costs of the program.</para>

    <para>The third and final section of the file gives a profile
    break-down by cost-centre stack.  This is roughly a call-graph
    profile of the program.  In the example above, it is clear that
    the costly call to <function>nfib</function> came from
    <function>main</function>.</para>

    <para>The time and allocation incurred by a given part of the
    program is displayed in two ways: &ldquo;individual&rdquo;, which
    are the costs incurred by the code covered by this cost centre
    stack alone, and &ldquo;inherited&rdquo;, which includes the costs
    incurred by all the children of this node.</para>

    <para>The usefulness of cost-centre stacks is better demonstrated
    by  modifying the example slightly:</para>

    <programlisting>
main = print (f 25 + g 25)
f n  = nfib n
g n  = nfib (n `div` 2)
nfib n = if n < 2 then 1 else nfib (n-1) + nfib (n-2)
</programlisting>

    <para>Compile and run this program as before, and take a look at
    the new profiling results:</para>

<screen>

    <para>Now although we had two calls to <function>nfib</function>
    in the program, it is immediately clear that it was the call from
    <function>f</function> which took all the time.</para>

    <para>The actual meaning of the various columns in the output is:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>entries</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The number of times this particular point in the call
	  graph was entered.</para>

      <varlistentry>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The percentage of the total memory allocations
	  (excluding profiling overheads) of the program made by this
	  call.</para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>inherited &percnt;alloc</term>
	<listitem>

	  (excluding profiling overheads) of the program made by this
	  call and all of its sub-calls.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>In addition you can use the <Option>-P</Option> RTS option
    <indexterm><primary><option>-P</option></primary></indexterm> to
    get the following additional information:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>ticks</literal></term>
	<listitem>
	  <Para>The raw number of time &ldquo;ticks&rdquo; which were
          attributed to this cost-centre; from this, we get the
          <literal>&percnt;time</literal> figure mentioned
          above.</Para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><literal>bytes</literal></term>
	<listItem>
	  <Para>Number of bytes allocated in the heap while in this
          cost-centre; again, this is the raw number from which we get
          the <literal>&percnt;alloc</literal> figure mentioned
          above.</Para>
	</listItem>
      </varListEntry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>What about recursive functions, and mutually recursive
    groups of functions?  Where are the costs attributed?  Well,
    although GHC does keep information about which groups of functions
    called each other recursively, this information isn't displayed in
    the basic time and allocation profile, instead the call-graph is
    flattened into a tree.  The XML profiling tool (described in <xref
    linkend="prof-xml-tool">) will be able to display real loops in
    the call-graph.</para>

    <sect2><title>Inserting cost centres by hand</title>

      <para>Cost centres are just program annotations.  When you say
      <option>-auto-all</option> to the compiler, it automatically
      inserts a cost centre annotation around every top-level function
      in your program, but you are entirely free to add the cost
      centre annotations yourself.</para>

      <para>The syntax of a cost centre annotation is</para>

      <programlisting>
     _scc_ "name" &lt;expression&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>where <literal>"name"</literal> is an aribrary string,
      that will become the name of your cost centre as it appears
      in the profiling output, and
      <literal>&lt;expression&gt;</literal> is any Haskell
      expression.  An <literal>_scc_</literal> annotation extends as
      far to the right as possible when parsing.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="prof-rules">
      <title>Rules for attributing costs</title>

      <para>The cost of evaluating any expression in your program is
      attributed to a cost-centre stack using the following rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the expression is part of the
	  <firstterm>one-off</firstterm> costs of evaluating the
	  enclosing top-level definition, then costs are attributed to
	  the stack of lexically enclosing <literal>_scc_</literal>
	  annotations on top of the special <literal>CAF</literal>
	  cost-centre. </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Otherwise, costs are attributed to the stack of
	  lexically-enclosing <literal>_scc_</literal> annotations,
	  appended to the cost-centre stack in effect at the
	  <firstterm>call site</firstterm> of the current top-level
	  definition<footnote> <para>The call-site is just the place
	  in the source code which mentions the particular function or
	  variable.</para></footnote>.  Notice that this is a recursive
	  definition.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>What do we mean by one-off costs?  Well, Haskell is a lazy
      language, and certain expressions are only ever evaluated once.
      For example, if we write:</para>

      <programlisting>
x = nfib 25
</programlisting>

      <para>then <varname>x</varname> will only be evaluated once (if
      at all), and subsequent demands for <varname>x</varname> will
      immediately get to see the cached result.  The definition
      <varname>x</varname> is called a CAF (Constant Applicative
      Form), because it has no arguments.</para>

      <para>For the purposes of profiling, we say that the expression
      <literal>nfib 25</literal> belongs to the one-off costs of
      evaluating <varname>x</varname>.</para>

      <para>Since one-off costs aren't strictly speaking part of the
      call-graph of the program, they are attributed to a special
      top-level cost centre, <literal>CAF</literal>.  There may be one
      <literal>CAF</literal> cost centre for each module (the
      default), or one for each top-level definition with any one-off
      costs (this behaviour can be selected by giving GHC the
      <option>-caf-all</option> flag).</para>

  <sect1 id="prof-heap">
    <title>Profiling memory usage</title>

    <para>In addition to profiling the time and allocation behaviour
    of your program, you can also generate a graph of its memory usage
    over time.  This is useful for detecting the causes of
    <firstterm>space leaks</firstterm>, when your program holds on to
    more memory at run-time that it needs to.  Space leaks lead to
    longer run-times due to heavy garbage collector ativity, and may
    even cause the program to run out of memory altogether.</para>

    <para>To generate a heap profile from your program, compile it as
    before, but this time run it with the <option>-h</option> runtime
    option.  This generates a file
    <filename>&lt;prog&gt;.hp</filename> file, which you then process
    with <command>hp2ps</command> to produce a Postscript file
    <filename>&lt;prog&gt;.ps</filename>.  The Postscript file can be
    viewed with something like <command>ghostview</command>, or
    printed out on a Postscript-compatible printer.</para>

    <para>For the RTS options that control the kind of heap profile
    generated, see <xref linkend="prof-rts-options">.  Details on the
    usage of the <command>hp2ps</command> program are given in <xref

    <title>Graphical time/allocation profile</title>

    <para>You can view the time and allocation profiling graph of your
    program graphically, using <command>ghcprof</command>.  This is a
    new tool with GHC 4.07, and will eventually be the de-facto
    standard way of viewing GHC profiles.</para>

    <para>The program
    <command>hp2ps</command><indexterm><primary>hp2ps
    program</primary></indexterm> converts a heap profile as produced
    by the <Option>-h&lt;break-down&gt;</Option> runtime option into a
    PostScript graph of the heap profile. By convention, the file to
    be processed by <command>hp2ps</command> has a
    <filename>.hp</filename> extension. The PostScript output is
    written to <filename>&lt;file&gt;@.ps</filename>. If

	<listItem>
	  <para>In order to make graphs more readable,

          identifier. The default sort ordering is for the bands with
          the largest area to be stacked on top of the smaller ones.
          The <Option>-d</Option> option causes rougher bands (those
          representing series of values with the largest standard
          deviations) to be stacked on top of smoother ones.</para>

	  <para>Generate encapsulated PostScript suitable for

          is drawn in landscape mode in an area 9 inches wide by 6
          inches high, and <command>hp2ps</command> arranges for this
          area to be approximately centred on a sheet of a4 paper.
          This format is convenient of studying the graph in detail,
          but it is unsuitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents.  The
          <Option>-e</Option> option causes the graph to be drawn in
          portrait mode, with float specifying the width in inches,
          millimetres or points (the default).  The resulting
          PostScript file conforms to the Encapsulated PostScript

    <title>Using &ldquo;ticky-ticky&rdquo; profiling (for implementors)</Title>
    <indexterm><primary>ticky-ticky profiling</primary></indexterm>

    <para>(ToDo: document properly.)</para>

    <para>It is possible to compile Glasgow Haskell programs so that
    they will count lots and lots of interesting things, e.g., number
    of updates, number of data constructors entered, etc., etc.  We
    call this &ldquo;ticky-ticky&rdquo;
    profiling,<indexterm><primary>ticky-ticky
    profiling</primary></indexterm> <indexterm><primary>profiling,
    ticky-ticky</primary></indexterm> because that's the sound a Sun4
    makes when it is running up all those counters
    (<Emphasis>slowly</Emphasis>).</para>

    <para>Ticky-ticky profiling is mainly intended for implementors;
    it is quite separate from the main &ldquo;cost-centre&rdquo;
    profiling system, intended for all users everywhere.</para>

    <para>To be able to use ticky-ticky profiling, you will need to
    have built appropriate libraries and things when you made the
    system.  See &ldquo;Customising what libraries to build,&rdquo; in
    the installation guide.</para>

    <para>To get your compiled program to spit out the ticky-ticky
    numbers, use a <Option>-r</Option> RTS
    option<indexterm><primary>-r RTS option</primary></indexterm>.
    See <XRef LinkEnd="runtime-control">.</para>

    <para>Compiling your program with the <Option>-ticky</Option>
    switch yields an executable that performs these counts.  Here is a
    sample ticky-ticky statistics file, generated by the invocation
    <command>foo +RTS -rfoo.ticky</command>.</para>

    <para>The formatting of the information above the row of asterisks
    is subject to change, but hopefully provides a useful
    human-readable summary.  Below the asterisks <Emphasis>all
    counters</Emphasis> maintained by the ticky-ticky system are
    dumped, in a format intended to be machine-readable: zero or more
    spaces, an integer, a space, the counter name, and a newline.</para>

    <para>In fact, not <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> counters are
    necessarily dumped; compile- or run-time flags can render certain
    counters invalid.  In this case, either the counter will simply
    not appear, or it will appear with a modified counter name,
    possibly along with an explanation for the omission (notice
    <literal>ENT&lowbar;PERM&lowbar;IND&lowbar;ctr</literal> appears
    with an inserted <literal>!</literal> above).  Software analysing
    this output should always check that it has the counters it
    expects.  Also, beware: some of the counters can have
