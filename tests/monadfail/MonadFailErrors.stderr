    • Could not deduce ‘MonadFail m’
        arising from a do statement
        with the failable pattern ‘Just x’
      from the context: Monad m
        bound by the type signature for:
                   general :: forall (m :: * -> *) a. Monad m => m a
        at MonadFailErrors.hs:12:1-25
      Possible fix:
        add (MonadFail m) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            general :: forall (m :: * -> *) a. Monad m => m a
