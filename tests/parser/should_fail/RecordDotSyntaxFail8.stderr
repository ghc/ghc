    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘print’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        instance Show Bar -- Defined at RecordDotSyntaxFail8.hs:22:41

        ...plus 13 instances involving out-of-scope types

    • No instance for ‘HasField "quux" Quux a0’
        arising from selecting the field ‘quux’
    • In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘....baz.quux’
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: print $ ....baz.quux
      In the expression:
        do let a = ...

    Suggested fix:
      NB: There is no field selector ‘quux :: Quux
