ParserNoTH1.hs:1:5: warning: [GHC-47082] [-Woperator-whitespace-ext-conflict (in -Wdefault)]
    The prefix use of a ‘$’ would denote an untyped splice
      were the TemplateHaskell extension enabled.
    Suggested fix: Add whitespace after the ‘$’.

ParserNoTH1.hs:1:5: error: [GHC-58481]
    parse error on input ‘$’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TemplateHaskell’ extension
