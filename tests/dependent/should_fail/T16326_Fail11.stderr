T16326_Fail11.hs:9:11: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall x -> x
    • When checking the class method: m :: forall a b. C a => b -> a
      In the class declaration for ‘C’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
