T16326_Fail9.hs:11:5: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall a -> a -> a
    • In the expression: lol @(forall a -> a -> a) undefined True
      In an equation for ‘t’:
          t = lol @(forall a -> a -> a) undefined True
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
