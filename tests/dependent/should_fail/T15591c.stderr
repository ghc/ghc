    • The kind of ‘T5’ is ill-scoped
        Inferred kind: T5 :: forall {b :: Proxy a}.
                             Proxy b -> forall a -> *
      Note: Inferred variables (namely: (b :: Proxy a))
            always come first.
      Perhaps try this order instead: a (b :: Proxy a) (c :: Proxy b)
