T16326_Fail5.hs:7:20: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall a1 -> Maybe a1
    • In a pattern type signature: forall a -> Maybe a
      In the pattern: Nothing :: forall a -> Maybe a
      In an equation for ‘isJust’:
          isJust (Nothing :: forall a -> Maybe a) = False
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
