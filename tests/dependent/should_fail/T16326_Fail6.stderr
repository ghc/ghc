T16326_Fail6.hs:9:3: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall a -> a -> Foo a
    • In the definition of data constructor ‘MkFoo’
      In the data type declaration for ‘Foo’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
