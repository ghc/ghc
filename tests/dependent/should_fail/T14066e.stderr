    • Expected a type, but ‘c'’ has kind ‘k1’
      ‘k1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          j :: forall {k1} {k2} (c :: k1) (b :: k2).
               Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c -> Proxy b
        at T14066e.hs:12:5-61
    • In the kind ‘c'’
      In the first argument of ‘Proxy’, namely ‘(b' :: c')’
      In an expression type signature: Proxy (b' :: c')
    • Relevant bindings include
        p2 :: Proxy c (bound at T14066e.hs:13:27)
        j :: Proxy a -> Proxy b -> Proxy c -> Proxy b
          (bound at T14066e.hs:13:5)
