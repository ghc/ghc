T16326_Fail2.hs:6:37: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall a -> a -> IO ()
    • In the type signature: blah :: forall a -> a -> IO ()
      When checking declaration:
        foreign import ccall safe "blah" blah :: forall a -> a -> IO ()
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
