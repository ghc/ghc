    • Expected kind ‘k0’, but ‘b’ has kind ‘k’
    • because kind variable ‘k’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) kind variable is bound by
      an explicit forall k (b :: k)
      at T14066.hs:15:36-45
    • In the second argument of ‘SameKind’, namely ‘b’
      In the type signature: g :: forall k (b :: k). SameKind a b
      In the expression:
        let
          g :: forall k (b :: k). SameKind a b
          g = undefined
        in ()
    • Relevant bindings include x :: Proxy a (bound at T14066.hs:15:4)
