    • Couldn't match kind: TypeReps xs
                     with: '[LiftedRep]
      Expected kind ‘TYPE (TupleRep (TypeReps xs))’,
        but ‘(# a #)’ has kind ‘TYPE (TupleRep '[LiftedRep])’
        The type variable ‘xs’ is ambiguous
    • In the type ‘(# a #)’
      In the type family declaration for ‘Tuple#’
      NB: Type ‘Tuple#’ was inferred to use visible dependent quantification.
      Most types with visible dependent quantification are
      polymorphically recursive and need a standalone kind
      signature. Perhaps supply one, with StandaloneKindSignatures.
