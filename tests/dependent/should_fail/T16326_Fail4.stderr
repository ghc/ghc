T16326_Fail4.hs:6:30: error: [GHC-51580]
    • Illegal visible, dependent quantification in the type of a term:
        forall a1 -> Maybe a1 -> Maybe a1 -> Maybe a1
    • In an expression type signature:
        forall a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
      In the first argument of ‘zipWith’, namely
        ‘((<>) :: forall a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a)’
      In the expression:
        zipWith ((<>) :: forall a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a) xs ys
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RequiredTypeArguments’ extension
