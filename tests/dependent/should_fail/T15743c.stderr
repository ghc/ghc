    • The kind of ‘T’ is ill-scoped
        Inferred kind: T :: forall {d :: k}.

      Note: Inferred variables (namely: (d :: k))
            always come first.
      Perhaps try this order instead:
        k
        (d :: k)
        (c :: k)
        (a :: Proxy c)
        (b :: Proxy d)
        (x :: SimilarKind a b)
