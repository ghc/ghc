T15076b.hs:9:8: error: [GHC-71451]
    • Cannot generalise type; skolem ‘a’ would escape its scope
      if I tried to quantify (x0 :: a) in this type:
        forall a (f :: forall (x :: a). Proxy @{a} x -> *).
        Proxy @{Proxy @{a} x0 -> *} (f @x0) -> ()
      (Indeed, I sometimes struggle even printing this correctly,
       due to its ill-scoped nature.)
    • In the type signature:
        foo :: forall (a :: Type)
                      (f :: forall (x :: a). Proxy x -> Type). Proxy f -> ()
