-- This is the integral benchmark from the nofib benchmark suite.
-- In the past there have been issues with numeric stability for this benchmark (see #19569)
-- so I added it to testsuite to catch such regressions in the future.

-- It might be acceptable for this test to fail if you make changes to the simplifier. But generally such a failure shouldn't be accepted without good reason.
--
-- For example, one of the numerical instabilities was/is caused by a rewrite rule
-- in GHC.Real which rewrites powers with small exponents. See !8082, changes in the
-- simplifier caused this rewrite rule to trigger (or not) which then produced different
-- results.

-- The excessive whitespace is the result of running the original benchmark which was a .lhs file through unlit.
