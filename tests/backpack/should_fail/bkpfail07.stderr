bkpfail07.bkp:6:9: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘T’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type T :: *
                   data T = T GHC.Internal.Types.Bool
        Hsig file: type T :: *
                   data T = T GHC.Internal.Types.Int
      The constructors do not match: The types for ‘T’ differ.
    • While checking that ‘h[A=<A>]:H’ implements signature ‘H’ in ‘p[H=h[A=<A>]:H]’.
