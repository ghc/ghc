bkpfail23.bkp:15:9: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘F’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type F :: * -> *
                   type F a = ()
        Hsig file: type role F phantom
                   type F :: * -> *
                   data F a
      Illegal parameterized type synonym in implementation of abstract data.
    • While checking that ‘h:H’ implements signature ‘H’ in ‘p[H=h:H]’.
    Suggested fix:
      If possible, eta-reduce the type synonym ‘F’ so that it is nullary.
