    • Type constructor ‘Either’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type Either :: * -> * -> *
                   data Either a b = Left a | Right b
        Hsig file: type role Either representational phantom phantom
                   type Either :: * -> * -> * -> *
                   data Either a b c = Left a
      The types have different kinds.
    • While checking that ‘Prelude’ implements signature ‘ShouldFail’ in ‘p[ShouldFail=Prelude]’.
