bkpfail14.bkp:9:9: error: [GHC-11890]
    • Identifier ‘f’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: f :: GHC.Internal.Types.Bool
        Hsig file: f :: GHC.Internal.Types.Int
      The two types are different.
    • While checking that ‘QMe’ implements signature ‘Q’ in ‘p[Q=QMe,Q2=Q2]’.
