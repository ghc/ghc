    • Class ‘C’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type C :: * -> Constraint
                   class C a where
                     f :: a -> a

                     default f :: a -> a
      The class methods do not match:
        The default methods associated with ‘f’ are not compatible.
      The MINIMAL pragmas are not compatible.
    • While checking that ‘i:A’ implements signature ‘A’ in ‘p[A=i:A,B=<B>]’.
