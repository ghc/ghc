bkpfail04.bkp:7:9: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘A’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type A :: *
                   data A = A {foo :: Int}
        Hsig file: type A :: *
                   data A = A {bar :: Bool}
      The constructors do not match:
        • The record label lists for ‘A’ differ.
        • The types for ‘A’ differ.
    • While merging the signatures from:
        • p[A=<A>]:A
        • q[A=<A>]:A
        • ...and the local signature for A
