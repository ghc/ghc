    • Type constructor ‘T’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type T :: *
                   data T = T Bool
        Hsig file: type T :: *
                   data T = T Int
      The constructors do not match: The types for ‘T’ differ.
    • While merging the signatures from:
        • p[H=<A>]:H
        • ...and the local signature for A
