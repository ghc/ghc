bkpfail46.bkp:16:9: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘K’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file.
      Main module: type K :: * -> Constraint
                   type K a = GHC.Internal.Classes.Eq a
        Hsig file: type K :: * -> Constraint
                   class K a
      Illegal parameterized type synonym in implementation of abstract data.
    • While checking that ‘q:A’ implements signature ‘A’ in ‘p[A=q:A]’.
    Suggested fix:
      If possible, eta-reduce the type synonym ‘K’ so that it is nullary.
