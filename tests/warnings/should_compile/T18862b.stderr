T18862b.hs:7:9: warning: [GHC-12003] [-Wtype-equality-out-of-scope (in -Wdefault)]
    • The ‘~’ operator is out of scope.
      Assuming it to stand for an equality constraint.
    • Note: ‘~’ used to be built-in syntax but now is a regular type operator
            exported from Data.Type.Equality and Prelude.
            If you are using a custom Prelude, consider re-exporting it.
    • This will become an error in a future GHC release.
