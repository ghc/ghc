T13837.hs:9:4: error: [GHC-97784]
    • The Name ‘Fam’ is not in scope.
    • In the argument of ‘reifyInstances’: Fam_0
      In the untyped splice:
        $(do fam_name <- newName "Fam"
             stringE . show =<< qReifyInstances fam_name [])
    Suggested fix:
      If you bound a unique Template Haskell name (NameU)
      perhaps via newName,
      then -ddump-splices might be useful.
