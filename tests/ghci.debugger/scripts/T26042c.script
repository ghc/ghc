:load T26042c.hs
-- Similar to base T26042b test, but uses tail calls.
-- Recall: for step-out, we skip the caller of tail calls
-- (because we don't push a stack frame for tail calls, so
-- there's no frame to trigger the breakpoint of)
-- This test observes that

-- break on foo True branch
:break 10
main
:list
-- step out of foo True and observe that we have skipped its call in bar,
-- and the call of bar in foo False.
-- we go straight to `main`.
:stepout
:list
-- stepping out from here will exit main
:stepout

-- this test is also run with optimisation to make sure the IO bindings inline and we can stop at them
