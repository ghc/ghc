T3834.hs:9:1: error: [GHC-82023]
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘C T’:
        ‘C’ is not a stock derivable class (Eq, Show, etc.)
    • In the stand-alone deriving instance for ‘C T’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving’ extension
      for GHC's newtype-deriving extension
