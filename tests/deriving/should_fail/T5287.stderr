    • Could not deduce ‘A a oops0’
      from the context: A a oops
        bound by an instance declaration:
                   forall a oops. A a oops => Read (D a)
        at T5287.hs:7:10-31
      The type variable ‘oops0’ is ambiguous
      Potentially matching instance:
        instance A Int Bool -- Defined at T5287.hs:13:10
    • In the ambiguity check for an instance declaration
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the instance declaration for ‘Read (D a)’
