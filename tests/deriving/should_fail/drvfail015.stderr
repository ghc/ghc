    • Illegal instance declaration for ‘Eq T’:
        All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn)
        where T is not a synonym.
    • In the stand-alone deriving instance for ‘Eq T’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TypeSynonymInstances’ extension (implied by ‘FlexibleInstances’)

drvfail015.hs:14:1: error: [GHC-54540]
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Eq Handle’:
        The data constructors of ‘Handle’ are not all in scope
          so you cannot derive an instance for it
    • In the stand-alone deriving instance for ‘Eq Handle’
