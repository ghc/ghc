drvfail007.hs:4:38: error: [GHC-39999]
    • No instance for ‘Eq (Int -> Int)’
        arising from the first field of ‘Foo’ (type ‘Int -> Int’)
        (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Eq Foo)
