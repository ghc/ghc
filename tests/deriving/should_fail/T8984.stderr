    • Couldn't match representation of type: cat a (N cat a Int)
                               with that of: cat a (cat a Int)
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘app’
          from type ‘cat a (cat a Int)’ to type ‘N cat a (N cat a Int)’
      Note: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘cat a’ have;
            we must assume that the role is nominal.
