T24955a.hs:10:12: warning: [GHC-55631] [-Wmissing-deriving-strategies]
    • No deriving strategy specified. Did you want stock, newtype, or anyclass?
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘N’
    Suggested fixes:
      • Use explicit deriving strategies:
          deriving stock (Show, Read)
          deriving newtype (Eq, Ord)
      • Perhaps you intended to use the ‘DerivingStrategies’ extension (implied by ‘DerivingVia’)
