T15798b.hs:9:1: warning: [GHC-55631] [-Wmissing-deriving-strategies]
    • No deriving strategy specified. Did you want stock, newtype, or anyclass?
    • In the stand-alone deriving instance for ‘Eq a => Eq (Foo a)’
    Suggested fixes:
      • Use an explicit deriving strategy:
          deriving stock instance Eq a => Eq (Foo a)
      • Perhaps you intended to use the ‘DerivingStrategies’ extension (implied by ‘DerivingVia’)
