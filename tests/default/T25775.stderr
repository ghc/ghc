    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘show’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        ...plus 25 others
        ...plus 13 instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the expression: show (f 0)
      In an equation for ‘x’: x = show (f 0)
