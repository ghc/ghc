T13324_compile2.hs:7:19: warning: [GHC-60661] [-Wpartial-type-signatures (in -Wdefault)]
    • Found type wildcard ‘_’ standing for ‘Show a’
    • In the instance declaration for ‘Show (Option a)’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘PartialTypeSignatures’ extension
      to use the inferred type
