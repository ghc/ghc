    • Could not deduce ‘Ord a’ arising from a use of ‘>’
      from the context: Show a
        bound by the inferred type of f :: Show a => a -> w -> Bool
        at T23223.hs:5:1-11
      Possible fix:
        add (Ord a) to the context of
          the inferred type of f :: Show a => a -> w -> Bool
    • In the expression: x > x
      In an equation for ‘f’: f x y = x > x
