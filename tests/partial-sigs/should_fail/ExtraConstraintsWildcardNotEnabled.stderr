    • Found extra-constraints wildcard standing for ‘Show a’
      Where: ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
               the inferred type of show' :: Show a => a -> String
               at ExtraConstraintsWildcardNotEnabled.hs:4:1-25
      To use the inferred type, enable PartialTypeSignatures
    • In the type signature: show' :: _ => a -> String
