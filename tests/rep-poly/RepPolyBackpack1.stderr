    The second pattern in the equation for ‘funcA’
    does not have a fixed runtime representation.
    Its type is:
      Number l :: TYPE (Rep l)

RepPolyBackpack1.bkp:17:17: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The argument ‘x’ of ‘plus’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        Number GHC.Internal.Types.Lifted :: TYPE (Rep l0)
      When unifying:
        • Number GHC.Internal.Types.Lifted
        • Number l
      Cannot unify ‘l’ with the type variable ‘l0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘Levity’.
    • In the expression: plus x (multiply x y)
      In an equation for ‘funcA’: funcA x y = plus x (multiply x y)
