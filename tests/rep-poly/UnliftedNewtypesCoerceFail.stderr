UnliftedNewtypesCoerceFail.hs:14:8: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of ‘coerce’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE k0
      When unifying:
        • a0 -> b0
        • x -> y
      Cannot unify ‘rep’ with the type variable ‘k0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: coerce
      In an equation for ‘goof’: goof = coerce
