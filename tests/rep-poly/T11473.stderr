    The first pattern in the equation for ‘hello’
    does not have a fixed runtime representation.
    Its type is:
      a :: TYPE r

    • The argument ‘x’ of ‘boxed’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE lev0
      When unifying:
        • a
        • a0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘lev0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the first argument of ‘boxed’, namely ‘x’
      In the expression: boxed x
      In an equation for ‘hello’: hello x = boxed x
