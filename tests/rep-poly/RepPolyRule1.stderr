    • The argument ‘x’ of ‘f’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:

        • a2
        • a1
      Cannot unify ‘rep’ with the type variable ‘rep0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘x’
      In the expression: f x
