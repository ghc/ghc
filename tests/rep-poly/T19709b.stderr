T19709b.hs:11:15: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The argument ‘(error @Any "e2")’ of ‘levfun’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a1 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘Any’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the first argument of ‘levfun’, namely ‘(error @Any "e2")’
      In the first argument of ‘seq’, namely ‘levfun (error @Any "e2")’
      In the expression: levfun (error @Any "e2") `seq` return []
