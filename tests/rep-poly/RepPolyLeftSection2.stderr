RepPolyLeftSection2.hs:14:11: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The argument ‘undefined’ of ‘f’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE r0
      When unifying:
        • a0 -> a0
        • a -> a
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘r0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: undefined `f`
      In an equation for ‘test1’: test1 = (undefined `f`)
