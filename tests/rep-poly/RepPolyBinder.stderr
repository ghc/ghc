    • The first pattern in the equation for ‘foo’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a :: TYPE rep1

      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:

RepPolyBinder.hs:11:17: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first argument of the view pattern
        myId
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        x0 :: TYPE rep0
      When unifying:
        • x0
        • b
      Cannot unify ‘rep2’ with the type variable ‘rep0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the pattern: myId -> bndr_b
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo bndr_a pat@(myId -> bndr_b) = ()
