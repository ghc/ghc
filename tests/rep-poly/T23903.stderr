T23903.hs:21:1: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first pattern in the equation for ‘f’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        t0 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘Rep a’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because the former is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • The equation for ‘f’ has one visible argument,
        but its type ‘a #-> ()’ has none
