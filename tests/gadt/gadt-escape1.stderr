    • Could not deduce ‘p ~ ExpGADT Int’
      from the context: t ~ Int
        bound by a pattern with constructor: ExpInt :: Int -> ExpGADT Int,
                 in a case alternative
        at gadt-escape1.hs:19:43-50
      Expected: p
        Actual: ExpGADT t
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of weird1 :: p
        at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1-58
    • In the expression: a
      In a case alternative: Hidden (ExpInt _) a -> a
      In the expression:
        case (hval :: Hidden) of Hidden (ExpInt _) a -> a
    • Relevant bindings include
        weird1 :: p (bound at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘weird1’ a type signature
