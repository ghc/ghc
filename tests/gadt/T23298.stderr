 T23298.hs:14:16: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Couldn't match type ‘x’ with ‘Maybe x’
      Expected: HList x -> t
        Actual: HList a -> t
      ‘x’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        a pattern with constructor:
          HCons :: forall x. HList x -> HList (Maybe x),
        in an equation for ‘go’
        at T23298.hs:14:5-11
    • In the expression: go x
      In an equation for ‘go’: go (HCons x) = go x
    • Relevant bindings include x :: HList x (bound at T23298.hs:14:11)
