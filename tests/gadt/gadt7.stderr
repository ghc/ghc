    • Could not deduce ‘p1 ~ p2’

    • In the expression: y1
      In a case alternative: K -> y1
      In the expression: case t1 of K -> y1
    • Relevant bindings include
        y1 :: p1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)

        i1b :: T a -> p1 -> p2 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘i1b’ a type signature
