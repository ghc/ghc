    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t’ with actual type ‘Maybe a’
      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: forall t -> t -> ()
        at T22326_fail_match.hs:7:1-25
    • In the pattern: type (Maybe a)
      In an equation for ‘f’: f (type (Maybe a)) x = ()
