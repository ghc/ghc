    • Couldn't match expected type ‘b’ with actual type ‘t0 -> t1’
      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: a -> forall b -> b
        at T22326_fail_n_args.hs:6:1-26
    • The equation for ‘f’ has three visible arguments,
        but its type ‘a -> forall b -> b’ has only two
