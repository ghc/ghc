TH_double_splice.hs:6:12: error: [GHC-26759]
    • Unexpected top-level splice.
    • In the untyped splice: $(error "should not happen")
      In the untyped splice: $($(error "should not happen"))
      In the Template Haskell quotation:
        [| $($(error "should not happen")) |]
    Suggested fix:
