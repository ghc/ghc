T9204.hs:7:1: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘D’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hs-boot file.
      Main module: type role D phantom
                   type D :: * -> *
                   data D a
        Boot file: type D :: * -> *
                   data D a
      The roles do not match.
      Note: Roles on abstract types default to ‘representational’ in hs-boot files.
    • In the data type declaration for ‘D’
