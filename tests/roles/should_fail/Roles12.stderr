Roles12.hs:6:1: error: [GHC-15843]
    • Type constructor ‘T’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hs-boot file.
      Main module: type role T phantom
                   type T :: * -> *
                   data T a
        Boot file: type T :: * -> *
                   data T a
      The roles do not match.
      Note: Roles on abstract types default to ‘representational’ in hs-boot files.
