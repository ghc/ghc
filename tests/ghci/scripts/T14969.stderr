<interactive>:2:1: error: [GHC-80003]
    • Non type-variable argument
        in the constraint: Num (t2 -> t1 -> t3)
    • When checking the inferred type
        it :: forall {t1} {t2} {t3}. (Num t1, Num (t2 -> t1 -> t3)) => t3
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘FlexibleContexts’ extension
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XFlexibleContexts
