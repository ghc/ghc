<interactive>:4:5: error: [GHC-80003]
    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: HasField "name" r a
    • When checking the inferred type
        foo :: forall {r} {a}. HasField "name" r a => r -> a
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘FlexibleContexts’ extension
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XFlexibleContexts
