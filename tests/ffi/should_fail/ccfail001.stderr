ccfail001.hs:10:1: error: [GHC-10964]
    • Unacceptable result type in foreign declaration:
        ‘State# RealWorld’ cannot be marshalled in a foreign call
        UnliftedFFITypes is required to marshal unlifted types
    • When checking declaration:
        foreign import ccall safe foo :: Int -> State# RealWorld
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘UnliftedFFITypes’ extension
