T15231.hs:15:10: error: [GHC-22979]
    • Variable ‘c’ occurs more often
        in the constraint ‘c’ than in the instance head ‘Z a’
    • In the quantified constraint ‘c => Z a’
      In the instance declaration for ‘Z (ECC c a)’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘UndecidableInstances’ extension
