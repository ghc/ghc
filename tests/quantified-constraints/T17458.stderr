    • Reduction stack overflow; size = 201
      When simplifying the following type: Typeable Void
    • In the expression: eqT
      In the expression:
        case eqT of
          Nothing -> False
          Just (Refl :: a :~: Void) -> True
      In an equation for ‘checkZ’:
          checkZ (Z (Z' :: Z' a))
            = case eqT of
                Nothing -> False
                Just (Refl :: a :~: Void) -> True
    Suggested fix:
      Use -freduction-depth=0 to disable this check
      (any upper bound you could choose might fail unpredictably with
       minor updates to GHC, so disabling the check is recommended if
       you're sure that type checking should terminate)
