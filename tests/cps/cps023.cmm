// Test foreign calls

// This test won't work until the parser is changes.
// Currently the parser calls emitForeignCall', even
// for safe foreign calls and that function
// creates only unsafe foreign calls.
// This will have to be changed to 
//   code (stmtC (CmmCall (CmmForeignCall expr convention) results args safety))
// so the CPS can get a hold of it.
