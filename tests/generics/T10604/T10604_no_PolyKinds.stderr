T10604_no_PolyKinds.hs:8:35: error: [GHC-62016]
    • Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form ‘Generic1 (F ...)’
        Class ‘Generic1’ expects an argument of kind ‘* -> *’
    • In the data type declaration for ‘F’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘PolyKinds’ extension
