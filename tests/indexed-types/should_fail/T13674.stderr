    • Couldn't match type ‘m’ with ‘Lcm m m’
      Expected: GF m
        Actual: GF (Lcm m m)
      ‘m’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          bar :: forall (m :: Nat). KnownNat m => GF m -> GF m -> GF m
        at T13674.hs:55:1-44
    • In the first argument of ‘(-)’, namely ‘foo x y’
      In the expression:
        foo x y - foo y x \\ lcmNat @m @m \\ Sub @() (lcmIsIdempotent @m)
      In an equation for ‘bar’:
          bar (x :: GF m) y
            = foo x y - foo y x \\ lcmNat @m @m \\ Sub @() (lcmIsIdempotent @m)
    • Relevant bindings include
        y :: GF m (bound at T13674.hs:56:17)
        x :: GF m (bound at T13674.hs:56:6)
        bar :: GF m -> GF m -> GF m (bound at T13674.hs:56:1)
