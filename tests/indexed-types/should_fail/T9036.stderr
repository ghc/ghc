    • Couldn't match type: GetMonad t0
                     with: GetMonad t
      Expected: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> Curried t [t]
        Actual: Maybe (GetMonad t0 after) -> Curried t0 [t0]
      Note: ‘GetMonad’ is a non-injective type family.
      The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    • In the ambiguity check for ‘simpleLogger’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the type signature:
        simpleLogger :: Maybe (GetMonad t after) -> t `Curried` [t]
