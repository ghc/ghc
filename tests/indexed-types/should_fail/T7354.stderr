    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Base t (Prim [a] a)’
      Expected: Prim [a] a -> Base t (Prim [a] a)
        Actual: Prim [a] a -> a
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of foo :: Prim [a] a -> t
        at T7354.hs:28:1-13
    • In the first argument of ‘ana’, namely ‘alg’
      In the expression: ana alg
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = ana alg
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: Prim [a] a -> t (bound at T7354.hs:28:1)
