T12522a.hs:23:26: error: [GHC-39999]
    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘show’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Relevant bindings include
        n :: a0 (bound at T12522a.hs:23:15)
        test :: Uncurried [a0, [Char]] [Char] (bound at T12522a.hs:23:1)
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        ...plus 25 others
        ...plus 13 instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the first argument of ‘(++)’, namely ‘show n’
      In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘show n ++ s’
      In the expression: I $ show n ++ s
