    • Couldn't match type: Depend a0
                     with: Depend a
      Expected: t (Depend a) -> Bool
        Actual: t (Depend a0) -> Bool
      Note: ‘Depend’ is a non-injective type family.
      The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    • In the ambiguity check for the inferred type for ‘isValid’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      When checking the inferred type
        isValid :: forall {t :: * -> *} {a}.
                   (Foldable t, Bug a) =>
