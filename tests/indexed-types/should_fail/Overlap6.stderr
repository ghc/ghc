    • Couldn't match type ‘x’ with ‘And x True’
      Expected: Proxy (And x True)
        Actual: Proxy x
      ‘x’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          g :: forall (x :: Bool). Proxy x -> Proxy (And x True)
        at Overlap6.hs:14:1-34
    • In the expression: x
      In an equation for ‘g’: g x = x
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: Proxy x (bound at Overlap6.hs:15:3)
        g :: Proxy x -> Proxy (And x True) (bound at Overlap6.hs:15:1)
