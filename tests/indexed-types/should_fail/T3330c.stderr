    • Could not deduce ‘Der f1 ~ f1’

      ‘f1’ is a rigid type variable bound by

    • The function ‘plug’ is applied to three visible arguments,
        but its type ‘Rep f => Der f x -> x -> f x’ has only two
      In the first argument of ‘Inl’, namely ‘(plug rf df x)’
      In the expression: Inl (plug rf df x)
    • Relevant bindings include
        df :: Der f1 x (bound at T3330c.hs:25:25)
        rf :: R f1 (bound at T3330c.hs:25:13)
