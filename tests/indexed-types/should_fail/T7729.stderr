    • Couldn't match type: BasePrimMonad m
                     with: t0 (BasePrimMonad m)
      Expected: t0 (BasePrimMonad m) a -> Rand m a
        Actual: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
    • In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘liftPrim’
      In the expression: liftPrim . lift
      In an equation for ‘liftPrim’: liftPrim = liftPrim . lift
