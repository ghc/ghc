    • Couldn't match expected type: Char -> Bool
                  with actual type: IO ()
    • The function ‘print’ is applied to two visible arguments,
        but its type ‘Show a => a -> IO ()’ has only one
      In the expression: print 'x' 'y'
      In an equation for ‘triggersLoop’:
          triggersLoop (Q _ _) (Q _ _) = print 'x' 'y'
