    • Could not deduce ‘a' ~ Tagged Int a’
      from the context: (TagImpl a a', b ~ DF a')
        bound by the instance declaration at T12538.hs:36:10-46
      Expected: Tagged Int a -> b
        Actual: Tagged Int a -> DF (Tagged Int a)
      ‘a'’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the instance declaration
        at T12538.hs:36:10-46
    • In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘DF’
      In the expression: DF . tag
      In an equation for ‘df’: df = DF . tag
    • Relevant bindings include df :: a -> b (bound at T12538.hs:37:3)
