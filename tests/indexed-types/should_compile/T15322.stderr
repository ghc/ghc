T15322.hs:11:6: warning: [GHC-62412] [-Wsimplifiable-class-constraints (in -Wdefault)]
    • The constraint ‘Typeable (n + 1)’ matches a built-in instance
      This makes type inference for inner bindings fragile;
        either use MonoLocalBinds, or simplify it using the instance
    • In the type signature:
        f :: forall n. (Typeable (n + 1), KnownNat n) =>
                       Proxy n -> TypeRep (n + 1)
