    • Expected kind ‘k’, but ‘b’ has kind ‘k0’
    • because kind variable ‘k’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) kind variable is bound by
      an explicit forall k (a :: k)

    • In the second argument of ‘SameKind’, namely ‘b’
      In the type signature:
        foo :: forall b. (forall k (a :: k). SameKind a b) -> ()
