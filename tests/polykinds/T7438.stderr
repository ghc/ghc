    • Could not deduce ‘p1 ~ p2’

        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   Nil :: forall {k} (a :: k). Thrist a a,

      ‘p1’ is a rigid type variable bound by

      ‘p2’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of go :: Thrist a b -> p1 -> p2

    • In the expression: acc
      In an equation for ‘go’: go Nil acc = acc
    • Relevant bindings include
        acc :: p1 (bound at T7438.hs:6:8)
        go :: Thrist a b -> p1 -> p2 (bound at T7438.hs:6:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘go’ a type signature
