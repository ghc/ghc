T22513b.hs:5:1: warning: [GHC-54201] [-Wterm-variable-capture]
    The type variable ‘id’ is implicitly quantified,
    even though another variable of the same name is in scope:
      ‘id’ imported from ‘Prelude’ at T22513b.hs:3:17-18
           (and originally defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Base’)
    This is not compatible with the RequiredTypeArguments extension.
    Suggested fix: Consider renaming the type variable.
