rnfail033.hs:2:21: error: [GHC-76037]
    Not in scope: ‘Data.List.map’
    Suggested fixes:
      • Perhaps use one of these:
          ‘Data.List.zip’ (imported from Data.List),
          ‘Data.List.or’ (imported from Data.List),
          ‘Data.List.all’ (imported from Data.List)
      • Remove ‘map’ from the explicit hiding list in the import of
        ‘Data.List’ (at rnfail033.hs:3:1-31).
