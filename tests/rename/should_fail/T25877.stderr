T25877.hs:5:8: error: [GHC-01928]
    • Data constructor out of scope: ‘X.A’.
      NB: the type constructor ‘X.A’ cannot appear in this position.
    • In the expression: X.A
      In an equation for ‘test’: test = X.A
    Suggested fixes:
      • Perhaps use ‘Y.A’ (imported from T25877_aux)
      • Add ‘A’ to the import list in the import of ‘T25877_aux’
        (at T25877.hs:2:1-36).
