T21605c.hs:5:13: error: [GHC-37479]
    ‘Prelude.head’ is a term-level binding
     and can not be used at the type level.
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.Read’ (imported from Prelude),
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.Real’ (imported from Prelude),
        type constructor or class ‘Prelude.ReadS’ (imported from Prelude)
