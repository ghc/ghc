mod134.hs:6:19: error: [GHC-76037]
    Not in scope: ‘Prelude.head’
    Suggested fixes:
      • Perhaps use one of these:
          ‘Prelude.read’ (imported from Prelude),
          ‘Prelude.reads’ (imported from Prelude),
          ‘Prelude.id’ (imported from Prelude)
      • Remove ‘head’ from the explicit hiding list in the import of
        ‘Prelude’ (at mod134.hs:4:1-28).
