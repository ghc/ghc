T20007.hs:1:29: error: [GHC-56449]
    In the import of ‘Data.Type.Equality’:
      an item called ‘(~)’ is exported, but it is a type.
    Suggested fixes:
      • Use the ‘ExplicitNamespaces’ extension (implied by ‘TypeFamilies’ and ‘TypeOperators’)
      • Add the ‘type’ keyword to the import statement:
          import Data.Type.Equality ( type (~) )
