    • Illegal instance declaration for ‘Eq String’:
        All instance types must be of the form (T t1 ... tn)
        where T is not a synonym.
    • In the instance declaration for ‘Eq String’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘TypeSynonymInstances’ extension (implied by ‘FlexibleInstances’)
