pmcOrPats.hs:21:1: warning: [GHC-61505]
    Pattern match checker ran into -fmax-pmcheck-models=30 limit, so
      • Redundant clauses might not be reported at all
      • Redundant clauses might be reported as inaccessible
      • Patterns reported as unmatched might actually be matched
    Suggested fix:
      Increase the limit or resolve the warnings to suppress this message.
