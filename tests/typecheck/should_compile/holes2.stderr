    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘show’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance (Show a, Show b) => Show (Either a b)

        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
