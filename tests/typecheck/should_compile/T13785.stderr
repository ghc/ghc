T13785.hs:21:5: warning: [GHC-55524] [-Wmonomorphism-restriction]
    • The Monomorphism Restriction applies to the bindings
      for ‘bar2’, ‘baz2’
    • In an equation for ‘foo’:
          foo
            = bar >> baz >> bar1 >> bar2
            where
                bar, baz :: m Char
                (bar, baz) = c
                (bar1, baz1) = c :: (m Char, m Char)
                (bar2, baz2) = c
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘baz2’ and ‘bar2’ a type signature
