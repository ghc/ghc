-- From the call to "try", we get [W] D (T e).
-- After using the instance for D, we get the QC [W] (forall m. C3 m ==> C1 (T e) m)

-- The Given "[G] C3 m" thus arises from superclass expansion
-- from "D (T e)", which contains a type family application, T.
-- So the logic in 'mkStrictSuperClasses' better be able to handle that when
-- expanding the superclasses of C3 (in this case, C2); in particular
-- ltPatersonSize needs to handle a type family in its second argument.
