LocalGivenEqs2.hs:14:15: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Could not deduce ‘p ~ Bool’
      from the context: F a ~ G b
        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   MkT :: forall a b. (F a ~ G b) => a -> b -> T,
                 in an equation for ‘f’
        at LocalGivenEqs2.hs:14:4-10
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of f :: T -> p
        at LocalGivenEqs2.hs:14:1-18
    • In the expression: True
      In an equation for ‘f’: f (MkT _ _) = True
    • Relevant bindings include
        f :: T -> p (bound at LocalGivenEqs2.hs:14:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘f’ a type signature
