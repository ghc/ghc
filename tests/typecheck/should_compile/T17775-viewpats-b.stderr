    • No instance for ‘Eq a’ arising from a use of ‘==’
      Possible fix:
        add (Eq a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            ex2 :: forall a. a -> a -> Int -> Eq a => Bool
    • In the expression: (==)
      In the expression: == x
      In the pattern: (== x) -> result
