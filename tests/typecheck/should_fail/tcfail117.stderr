    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Enum N1’:
        ‘N1’ must be an enumeration type
        (an enumeration consists of one or more nullary, non-GADT constructors)
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘N1’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving’ extension
      for GHC's newtype-deriving extension
