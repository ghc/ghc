    • Couldn't match type: [a1]
                     with: a -> a0
      Expected: (a -> a0) -> [a] -> m [a]
        Actual: [a1] -> [a1]
    • Possible cause: ‘take’ is applied to too many arguments
      In the expression: take 2
      In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group by x using take 2
      In the expression:
        [GHC.List.length x | x <- [1 .. 10], then group by x using take 2]
