tcfail133.hs:70:7: error: [GHC-39999]
    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘show’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      Potentially matching instances:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Internal.Show’
        instance (Number a, Digit b, Show a, Show b) => Show (a :@ b)
          -- Defined at tcfail133.hs:11:54
        ...plus 28 others
        ...plus 13 instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the first argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘show’
      In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
      In an equation for ‘foo’:
          foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
