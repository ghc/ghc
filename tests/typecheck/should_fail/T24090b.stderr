T24090b.hs:8:19: warning: [GHC-16382] [-Wimplicit-rhs-quantification (in -Wdefault)]
    The variable ‘a’ occurs free on the RHS of the type declaration
    The next version of GHC will reject this program, no longer implicitly quantify over ‘a’
    Suggested fix: Bind ‘a’ on the LHS of the type declaration
