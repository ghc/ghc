    • Could not deduce ‘a ~ c’

      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by

    • Could not deduce ‘Show a’ arising from a use of ‘show’
      from the context: Ord a
        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   IGetKnockedDown :: forall a. (Eq a, Ord a) => a -> Chumbawamba a,
                 in an equation for ‘goo’

      Possible fix:
        add (Show a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            goo :: forall a. Chumbawamba a -> String
    • In the expression: show x
      In an equation for ‘goo’: goo (IGetKnockedDown x) = show x
