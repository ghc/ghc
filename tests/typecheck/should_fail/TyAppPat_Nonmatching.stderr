TyAppPat_Nonmatching.hs:9:6: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘Int’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          foo :: forall a. Maybe a -> a
        at TyAppPat_Nonmatching.hs:8:1-19
    • In the pattern: Just @Int x
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo (Just @Int x) = x
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: Maybe a -> a (bound at TyAppPat_Nonmatching.hs:9:1)
