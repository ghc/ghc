    • Could not deduce ‘C a’ arising from a use of ‘h’
      from the context: D a
        bound by the type signature for:
                   g :: forall a. D a => a
        at T19977b.hs:20:1-13
      Possible fix:
        add (C a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            g :: forall a. D a => a
    • In the expression: h
      In an equation for ‘g’: g = h
