    • Couldn't match type ‘Bool’ with ‘Int -> Bool’
      Expected: Int -> Int -> Bool
        Actual: Int -> Bool
    • Possible cause: ‘f1’ is applied to too many arguments
      In the first argument of ‘foo’, namely ‘(f1 2 3)’
      In the expression: foo (f1 2 3)
      In an equation for ‘g1’: g1 = foo (f1 2 3)
