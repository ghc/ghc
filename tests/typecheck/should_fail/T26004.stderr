T26004.hs:13:21: error: [GHC-25897]
    • Could not deduce ‘p ~ Bool’
      from the context: a ~ Bool
        bound by a pattern with constructor: T1 :: T Bool,
                 in a case alternative
        at T26004.hs:13:3-4
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of f :: p -> T a -> Bool
        at T26004.hs:(12,1)-(14,12)
    • In the first argument of ‘not’, namely ‘w’
      In the expression: not w
      In an equation for ‘y’: y = not w
    • Relevant bindings include
        w :: p (bound at T26004.hs:12:3)
        f :: p -> T a -> Bool (bound at T26004.hs:12:1)
    Suggested fix: Consider giving ‘f’ a type signature
