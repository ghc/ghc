    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘HsDoc id0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          gfoldl' :: forall (c :: * -> *) a.

    • In the pattern: DocEmpty
      In a case alternative: DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
      In the expression: case hsDoc of DocEmpty -> z DocEmpty
    • Relevant bindings include
