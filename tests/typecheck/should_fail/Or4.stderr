    • No instance for ‘Num a’ arising from the literal ‘3’
      Possible fix:
        add (Num a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            bar :: forall a. G a -> a
    • In the expression: 3
      In an equation for ‘bar’: bar (G2; G1) = 3

    • No instance for ‘Num a’ arising from a use of ‘+’
      Possible fix:
        add (Num a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            foo :: forall a. a -> GADT a -> a
    • In the expression: x + 1
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo x (IsInt1 {}; IsInt2 {}) = x + 1
