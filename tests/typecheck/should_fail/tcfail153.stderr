    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Bool’
      Expected: [a]
        Actual: [Bool]
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:

    • In the expression: g x
      In an equation for ‘f’:
          f x
            = g x
            where
                g y = if y then [] else [...]
