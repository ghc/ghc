T8883.hs:21:1: error: [GHC-80003]
    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Functor (PF t)
    • When checking the inferred type
        fold :: forall {t} {b}.
                (Functor (PF t), Regular t) =>
                (PF t b -> b) -> t -> b
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘FlexibleContexts’ extension
