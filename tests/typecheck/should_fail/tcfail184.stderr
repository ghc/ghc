tcfail184.hs:9:19: error: [GHC-91510]
    • Illegal polymorphic type: forall a. Ord a => [a] -> [a]
    • In the definition of data constructor ‘MkSwizzle’
      In the newtype declaration for ‘Swizzle’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RankNTypes’ extension (implied by ‘ImpredicativeTypes’)
