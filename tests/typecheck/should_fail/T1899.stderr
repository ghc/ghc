    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’
                  with actual type ‘Proposition a0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          transRHS :: forall a. [a] -> Int -> Constraint a
        at T1899.hs:9:2-39
    • In the first argument of ‘Prop’, namely ‘(Auxiliary undefined)’
      In the expression: Prop (Auxiliary undefined)
      In the expression: [Prop (Auxiliary undefined)]
    • Relevant bindings include
        varSet :: [a] (bound at T1899.hs:10:11)
        transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a (bound at T1899.hs:10:2)
