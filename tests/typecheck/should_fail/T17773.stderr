    • Found hole: _Refl :: Mzero x y :~: (x <|> y)
      Where: ‘x’, ‘f’, ‘k’, ‘a’, ‘y’ are rigid type variables bound by
               the type signature for:
                 monadPlusMplus :: forall {k} (f :: k -> *) (a :: k) (x :: f a)

               at T17773.hs:(13,1)-(15,41)
      Or perhaps ‘_Refl’ is mis-spelled, or not in scope
    • In an equation for ‘monadPlusMplus’: monadPlusMplus _ _ = _Refl
    • Relevant bindings include
        monadPlusMplus :: Proxy x -> Proxy y -> Mzero x y :~: (x <|> y)
