T12083b.hs:7:5: error: [GHC-91510]
    • Illegal qualified type: Eq a => r
    • When checking the class method:
        test :: forall a r. Class a => a -> (Eq a => r) -> r
      In the class declaration for ‘Class’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘RankNTypes’ extension (implied by ‘ImpredicativeTypes’)
