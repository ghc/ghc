mc23.hs:9:29: error: [GHC-83865]
    • Couldn't match type: [a0]
                     with: a -> b
      Expected: (a -> b) -> [a] -> m a
        Actual: [a0] -> [a0]
    • Possible cause: ‘take’ is applied to too many arguments
      In the expression: take 5
      In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then take 5 by x
      In the expression: [x | x <- [1 .. 10], then take 5 by x]
    • Relevant bindings include z :: m b (bound at mc23.hs:9:1)
