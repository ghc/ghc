    • Couldn't match type: b0 -> a
                     with: forall (proxy :: * -> *). proxy Any -> a
        arising from a use of ‘withDict’
    • In the expression:
        withDict @(Reifies (Any @Type) a) @_ (const a) (k @Any) Proxy
      In an equation for ‘reify’:
          reify a k
            = withDict @(Reifies (Any @Type) a) @_ (const a) (k @Any) Proxy
    • Relevant bindings include
        k :: forall s. Reifies s a => Proxy s -> r
