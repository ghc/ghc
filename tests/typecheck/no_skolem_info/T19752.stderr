    • Could not deduce ‘F b0 ~ a’
      from the context: F b ~ a

    • In the ambiguity check for ‘f’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the type signature: f :: (F b ~ a) => a
      In an equation for ‘g’:
          g = f

                f :: (F b ~ a) => a
                f = undefined
    • Relevant bindings include g :: a (bound at T19752.hs:10:1)
