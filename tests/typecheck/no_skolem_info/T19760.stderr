    • Couldn't match kind ‘a'’ with ‘a’
      Expected kind ‘Maybe a’, but ‘m'’ has kind ‘Maybe a'’

      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: forall a (p :: Maybe a -> *) (m :: Maybe a). p m
        at T19760.hs:8:1-56
    • In the first argument of ‘p’, namely ‘m'’
      In the type signature: go :: forall a' (m' :: Maybe a'). p m'
      In an equation for ‘f’:
          f = go

                go :: forall a' (m' :: Maybe a'). p m'
                go = undefined
    • Relevant bindings include f :: p m (bound at T19760.hs:9:1)
