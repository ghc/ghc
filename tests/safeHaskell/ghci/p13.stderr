    • Unsafe overlapping instances for Pos [Int]
        arising from a use of ‘res’
      The matching instance is:
        instance [overlapping] [safe] Pos [Int]
          -- Defined at <interactive>:9:30
      It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
      overlap instances from the same module, however it
      overlaps the following instances from different modules:
        instance [safe] Pos [a] -- Defined at P13_A.hs:6:10
    • In the expression: res [1 :: Int, 2 :: Int]
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = res [1 :: Int, 2 :: Int]
