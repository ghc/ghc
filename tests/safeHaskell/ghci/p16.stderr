    -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving is not allowed in Safe Haskell; ignoring -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving

<interactive>:16:29: error: [GHC-82023]
    • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Op T2’:
        ‘Op’ is not a stock derivable class (Eq, Show, etc.)
    • In the newtype declaration for ‘T2’
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps you intended to use the ‘GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving’ extension
      for GHC's newtype-deriving extension
      You may enable this language extension in GHCi with:
        :set -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving

<interactive>:19:9: error: [GHC-88464]
    Data constructor not in scope: T2 :: T -> t
    Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘T1’ (line 13)

<interactive>:22:4: error: [GHC-88464] Variable not in scope: y
