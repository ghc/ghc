<interactive>:12:1: error: [GHC-57638]
    • Unacceptable result type in foreign declaration:
        Safe Haskell is on, all FFI imports must be in the IO monad
    • When checking declaration:
        foreign import ccall safe "sin" c_sin :: Double -> Double

<interactive>:13:1: error: [GHC-88464]
    Variable not in scope: c_sin :: t0 -> t
    Suggested fix: Perhaps use ‘c_sin'’ (line 8)
