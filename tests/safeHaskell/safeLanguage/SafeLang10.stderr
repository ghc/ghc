    • Unsafe overlapping instances for Pos [Int]
        arising from a use of ‘res’
      The matching instance is:
        instance [overlapping] [safe] Pos [Int]
          -- Defined at SafeLang10_B.hs:14:30
      It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
      overlap instances from the same module, however it
      overlaps the following instances from different modules:
        instance Pos [a] -- Defined at SafeLang10_A.hs:14:10
    • In the expression: res [(1 :: Int)]
      In an equation for ‘r’: r = res [(1 :: Int)]
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: let r = res [(1 :: Int)]
