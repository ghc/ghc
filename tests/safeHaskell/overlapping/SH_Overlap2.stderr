SH_Overlap2.hs:19:8: error: [GHC-36705]
    • Unsafe overlapping instances for C [Int]
        arising from a use of ‘f’
      The matching instance is:
        instance [overlap ok] [safe] C [Int]
          -- Defined at SH_Overlap2_A.hs:12:3
      It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
      overlap instances from the same module, however it
      overlaps the following instances from different modules:
        instance C [a] -- Defined at SH_Overlap2.hs:15:3
    • In the expression: f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
      In an equation for ‘test’: test = f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
