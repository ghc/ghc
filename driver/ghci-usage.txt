Usage:

    ghci [command-line-options-and-input-files]

The kinds of input files that can be given on the command-line
include:

  - Haskell source files (.hs or .lhs suffix)
  - Object files (.o suffix, or .obj on Windows)
  - Dynamic libraries (.so suffix, or .dll on Windows)

In addition, ghci accepts most of the command-line options that plain
GHC does.  Some of the options that are commonly used are:

    -i<dir>         Search for imported modules in the directory <dir>.

    -H32m	    Increase GHC's default heap size to 32m

    -cpp            Enable CPP processing of source files
