Note [Fixity signature lookup]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A fixity declaration like

    infixr 2 ?

can refer to a value-level operator, e.g.:

    (?) :: String -> String -> String

or a type-level operator, like:

    data (?) a b = A a | B b

so we extend the lookup of the reader name '?' to the TcClsName namespace, as
well as the original namespace.

The extended lookup is also used in other places, like resolution of
deprecation declarations, and lookup of names in GHCi.

--------------------------------
lookupFixity is a bit strange.

* Nested local fixity decls are put in the local fixity env, which we
  find with getFixtyEnv

* Imported fixities are found in the PIT

* Top-level fixity decls in this module may be for Names that are
    either  Global         (constructors, class operations)
    or      Local/Exported (everything else)
  (See notes with RnNames.getLocalDeclBinders for why we have this split.)
  We put them all in the local fixity environment
