-- Note [Cmm Switches, the general plan]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Compiling a high-level switch statement, as it comes out of a STG case
-- expression, for example, allows for a surprising amount of design decisions.
-- Therefore, we cleanly separated this from the Stg → Cmm transformation, as
-- well as from the actual code generation.
--
-- The overall plan is:
--  * The Stg → Cmm transformation creates a single `SwitchTargets` in
--    emitSwitch and emitCmmLitSwitch in StgCmmUtils.hs.
--    At this stage, they are unsuitable for code generation.
--  * A dedicated Cmm transformation (CmmImplementSwitchPlans) replaces these
--    switch statements with code that is suitable for code generation, i.e.
--    a nice balanced tree of decisions with dense jump tables in the leafs.
--    The actual planning of this tree is performed in pure code in createSwitchPlan
--    in this module. See Note [createSwitchPlan].
--  * The actual code generation will not do any further processing and
--    implement each CmmSwitch with a jump tables.
--
-- When compiling to LLVM or C, CmmImplementSwitchPlans leaves the switch
-- statements alone, as we can turn a SwitchTargets value into a nice
-- switch-statement in LLVM resp. C, and leave the rest to the compiler.
--
-- See Note [CmmSwitch vs. CmmImplementSwitchPlans] why the two module are
-- separated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Note [Magic Constants in CmmSwitch]
--
-- There are a lot of heuristics here that depend on magic values where it is
-- hard to determine the "best" value (for whatever that means). These are the
-- magic values:

-- | Number of consecutive default values allowed in a jump table. If there are
-- more of them, the jump tables are split.
--
-- Currently 7, as it costs 7 words of additional code when a jump table is
-- split (at least on x64, determined experimentally).
maxJumpTableHole :: Integer
maxJumpTableHole = 7

-- | Minimum size of a jump table. If the number is smaller, the switch is
-- implemented using conditionals.
-- Currently 5, because an if-then-else tree of 4 values is nice and compact.
minJumpTableSize :: Int
minJumpTableSize = 5

-- | Minimum non-zero offset for a jump table. See Note [Jump Table Offset].
minJumpTableOffset :: Integer
minJumpTableOffset = 2

-- Switch Targets

-- Note [SwitchTargets]:
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- The branches of a switch are stored in a SwitchTargets, which consists of an
-- (optional) default jump target, and a map from values to jump targets.
--
-- If the default jump target is absent, the behaviour of the switch outside the
-- values of the map is undefined.
--
-- We use an Integer for the keys the map so that it can be used in switches on
-- unsigned as well as signed integers.
--
-- The map may be empty (we prune out-of-range branches here, so it could be us
-- emptying it).
--
-- Before code generation, the table needs to be brought into a form where all
-- entries are non-negative, so that it can be compiled into a jump table.
-- See switchTargetsToTable.


-- | A value of type SwitchTargets contains the alternatives for a 'CmmSwitch'
-- value, and knows whether the value is signed, the possible range, an
-- optional default value and a map from values to jump labels.

-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-- A SwitchPlan describes how a Switch statement is to be broken down into

--
-- createSwitchPlan creates such a switch plan, in these steps:
--  1. It splits the switch statement at segments of non-default values that
--     are too large. See splitAtHoles and Note [Magic Constants in CmmSwitch]
--  2. Too small jump tables should be avoided, so we break up smaller pieces
--     in breakTooSmall.
--  3. We fill in the segments between those pieces with a jump to the default
--     label (if there is one), returning a SeparatedList in mkFlatSwitchPlan
--  4. We find and replace two less-than branches by a single equal-to-test in
--     findSingleValues
--  5. The thus collected pieces are assembled to a balanced binary tree.

-- Note [CmmSwitch vs. CmmImplementSwitchPlans]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- I (Joachim) separated the two somewhat closely related modules
--
--  - CmmSwitch, which provides the CmmSwitchTargets type and contains the strategy
--    for implementing a Cmm switch (createSwitchPlan), and
--  - CmmImplementSwitchPlans, which contains the actuall Cmm graph modification,
--
-- for these reasons:
--
--  * CmmSwitch is very low in the dependency tree, i.e. does not depend on any
--    GHC specific modules at all (with the exception of Output and Hoople
--    (Literal)). CmmImplementSwitchPlans is the Cmm transformation and hence very
--    high in the dependency tree.
--  * CmmSwitch provides the CmmSwitchTargets data type, which is abstract, but
--    used in CmmNodes.
--  * Because CmmSwitch is low in the dependency tree, the separation allows
--    for more parallelism when building GHC.
--  * The interaction between the modules is very explicit and easy to
--    understand, due to the small and simple interface.
