{- Note [Foreign calls]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A CmmUnsafeForeignCall is used for *unsafe* foreign calls;
a CmmForeignCall call is used for *safe* foreign calls.

Unsafe ones are mostly easy: think of them as a "fat machine
instruction".  In particular, they do *not* kill all live registers,
just the registers they return to (there was a bit of code in GHC that
conservatively assumed otherwise.)  However, see [Register parameter passing].

Safe ones are trickier.  A safe foreign call
     r = f(x)
ultimately expands to
     push "return address"      -- Never used to return to;
                                -- just points an info table
     save registers into TSO
     call suspendThread
     r = f(x)                   -- Make the call
     call resumeThread
     restore registers
     pop "return address"
We cannot "lower" a safe foreign call to this sequence of Cmms, because
after we've saved Sp all the Cmm optimiser's assumptions are broken.

Note that a safe foreign call needs an info table.

So Safe Foreign Calls must remain as last nodes until the stack is
made manifest in CmmLayoutStack, where they are lowered into the above
sequence.
-}

{- Note [Unsafe foreign calls clobber caller-save registers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A foreign call is defined to clobber any GlobalRegs that are mapped to
caller-saves machine registers (according to the prevailing C ABI).
StgCmmUtils.callerSaves tells you which GlobalRegs are caller-saves.

This is a design choice that makes it easier to generate code later.
We could instead choose to say that foreign calls do *not* clobber
caller-saves regs, but then we would have to figure out which regs
were live across the call later and insert some saves/restores.

Furthermore when we generate code we never have any GlobalRegs live
across a call, because they are always copied-in to LocalRegs and
copied-out again before making a call/jump.  So all we have to do is
avoid any code motion that would make a caller-saves GlobalReg live
across a foreign call during subsequent optimisations.
-}

{- Note [Register parameter passing]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On certain architectures, some registers are utilized for parameter
passing in the C calling convention.  For example, in x86-64 Linux
convention, rdi, rsi, rdx and rcx (as well as r8 and r9) may be used for
argument passing.  These are registers R3-R6, which our generated
code may also be using; as a result, it's necessary to save these
values before doing a foreign call.  This is done during initial
code generation in callerSaveVolatileRegs in StgCmmUtils.hs.  However,
one result of doing this is that the contents of these registers
may mysteriously change if referenced inside the arguments.  This
is dangerous, so you'll need to disable inlining much in the same
way is done in cmm/CmmOpt.hs currently.  We should fix this!

-- | Tickish in Cmm context (annotations only)
type CmmTickish = Tickish ()

-- | Tick scope identifier, allowing us to reason about what
-- annotations in a Cmm block should scope over. We especially take
-- care to allow optimisations to reorganise blocks without losing
-- tick association in the process.
data CmmTickScope
  = GlobalScope
    -- ^ The global scope is the "root" of the scope graph. Every
    -- scope is a sub-scope of the global scope. It doesn't make sense
    -- to add ticks to this scope. On the other hand, this means that
    -- setting this scope on a block means no ticks apply to it.

  | SubScope !U.Unique CmmTickScope
    -- ^ Constructs a new sub-scope to an existing scope. This allows
    -- us to translate Core-style scoping rules (see @tickishScoped@)
    -- into the Cmm world. Suppose the following code:
    --
    --   tick<1> case ... of
    --             A -> tick<2> ...
    --             B -> tick<3> ...
    --
    -- We want the top-level tick annotation to apply to blocks
    -- generated for the A and B alternatives. We can achieve that by
    -- generating tick<1> into a block with scope a, while the code
    -- for alternatives A and B gets generated into sub-scopes a/b and
    -- a/c respectively.

  | CombinedScope CmmTickScope CmmTickScope
    -- ^ A combined scope scopes over everything that the two given
    -- scopes cover. It is therefore a sub-scope of either scope. This
    -- is required for optimisations. Consider common block elimination:
    --
    --   A -> tick<2> case ... of
    --     C -> [common]
    --   B -> tick<3> case ... of
    --     D -> [common]
    --
    -- We will generate code for the C and D alternatives, and figure
    -- out afterwards that it's actually common code. Scoping rules
    -- dictate that the resulting common block needs to be covered by
    -- both tick<2> and tick<3>, therefore we need to construct a
    -- scope that is a child to *both* scope. Now we can do that - if
    -- we assign the scopes a/c and b/d to the common-ed up blocks,
    -- the new block could have a combined tick scope a/c+b/d, which
    -- both tick<2> and tick<3> apply to.

-- Note [CmmTick scoping details]:
--
-- The scope of a @CmmTick@ is given by the @CmmEntry@ node of the
-- same block. Note that as a result of this, optimisations making
-- tick scopes more specific can *reduce* the amount of code a tick
-- scopes over. Fixing this would require a separate @CmmTickScope@
-- field for @CmmTick@. Right now we do not do this simply because I
-- couldn't find an example where it actually mattered -- multiple
-- blocks within the same scope generally jump to each other, which
-- prevents common block elimination from happening in the first
-- place. But this is no strong reason, so if Cmm optimisations become
-- more involved in future this might have to be revisited.
