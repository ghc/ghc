Note [Pass sensitive types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the same AST types are re-used through parsing,renaming and type
checking there are naturally some places in the AST that do not have
any meaningful value prior to the pass they are assigned a value.

Historically these have been filled in with place holder values of the form

  panic "error message"

This has meant the AST is difficult to traverse using standard generic
programming techniques. The problem is addressed by introducing
pass-specific data types, implemented as a pair of open type families,
one for PostTc and one for PostRn. These are then explicitly populated
with a PlaceHolder value when they do not yet have meaning.

In terms of actual usage, we have the following

  PostTc id Kind
  PostTc id Type

  PostRn id Fixity
  PostRn id NameSet

TcId and Var are synonyms for Id

Unfortunately the type checker termination checking conditions fail for the
DataId constraint type based on this, so even though it is safe the
UndecidableInstances pragma is required where this is used.
