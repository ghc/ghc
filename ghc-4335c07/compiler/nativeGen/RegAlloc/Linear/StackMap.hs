-- | The assignment of virtual registers to stack slots

--      We have lots of stack slots. Memory-to-memory moves are a pain on most
--      architectures. Therefore, we avoid having to generate memory-to-memory moves
--      by simply giving every virtual register its own stack slot.

--      The StackMap stack map keeps track of virtual register - stack slot
--      associations and of which stack slots are still free. Once it has been
--      associated, a stack slot is never "freed" or removed from the StackMap again,
--      it remains associated until we are done with the current CmmProc.
