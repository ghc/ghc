-- | Handles joining of a jump instruction to its targets.

--      The first time we encounter a jump to a particular basic block, we
--      record the assignment of temporaries.  The next time we encounter a
--      jump to the same block, we compare our current assignment to the
--      stored one.  They might be different if spilling has occurred in one
--      branch; so some fixup code will be required to match up the assignments.
