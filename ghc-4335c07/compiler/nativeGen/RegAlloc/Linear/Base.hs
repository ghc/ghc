-- | Used to store the register assignment on entry to a basic block.
--      We use this to handle join points, where multiple branch instructions
--      target a particular label. We have to insert fixup code to make
--      the register assignments from the different sources match up.

-- | Where a vreg is currently stored
--      A temporary can be marked as living in both a register and memory
--      (InBoth), for example if it was recently loaded from a spill location.
--      This makes it cheap to spill (no save instruction required), but we
--      have to be careful to turn this into InReg if the value in the
--      register is changed.

--      This is also useful when a temporary is about to be clobbered.  We
--      save it in a spill location, but mark it as InBoth because the current
--      instruction might still want to read it.
