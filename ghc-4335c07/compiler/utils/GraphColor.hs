-- | Try to color a graph with this set of colors.
--      Uses Chaitin's algorithm to color the graph.
--      The graph is scanned for nodes which are deamed 'trivially colorable'. These nodes
--      are pushed onto a stack and removed from the graph.
--      Once this process is complete the graph can be colored by removing nodes from
--      the stack (ie in reverse order) and assigning them colors different to their neighbors.

-- | Scan through the conflict graph separating out trivially colorable and
--      potentially uncolorable (problem) nodes.
--
--      Checking whether a node is trivially colorable or not is a resonably expensive operation,
--      so after a triv node is found and removed from the graph it's no good to return to the 'start'
--      of the graph and recheck a bunch of nodes that will probably still be non-trivially colorable.
--
--      To ward against this, during each pass through the graph we collect up a list of triv nodes
--      that were found, and only remove them once we've finished the pass. The more nodes we can delete
--      at once the more likely it is that nodes we've already checked will become trivially colorable
--      for the next pass.
--
--      TODO:   add work lists to finding triv nodes is easier.
--              If we've just scanned the graph, and removed triv nodes, then the only
--              nodes that we need to rescan are the ones we've removed edges from.
