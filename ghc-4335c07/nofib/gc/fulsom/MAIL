Hi,

I've taken a wee hack at my solid modelling program, integrating the
hbc and glhc versions into one.  And it all seems to work...

I've now got a program that can run for half an hour in 96M of memory
and produce a beautiful picture as output.  Or else it can run for
about quarter the time in half the memory, or a sixteenth the time....

The faster the program, the less beautiful the output.

In it's default state, it runs for just less that a minute, in 8Meg
of memory, on a SS-10.  The hbc-compiled version, using -gc-gen, also
8Megs of memory takes about three minutes...  The output is identical.

I'm sure it's got some lurking space leaks in it, but I spend a good long
while last year getting rid of some real whoppers.  I think I cut the
space*time numbers by a factor of well over a hundred, so I'm pretty happy.

Anyhow, I thought it might make a nice curiosity for you...

What should I do with it now?  Is there anything I need to do to it
to make it more commpatible with your benchmark stuff, etc..?
