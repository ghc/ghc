Hi! I'm Eliza. I am your personal therapy computer.
Please tell me your problem.

I'm not sure I understand you fully.

We were discussing you --not me.

Why do you ask?

Oh, do?

What does that suggest to you?

Do computers worry you?

You're not really talking about me, are you?

I see.

Can you elaborate on that?

Why do you ask?

Did you come to me because you are asking questions, not me?

Are you saying no just to be negative?

You seem quite positive.

How long have you been not?
