Prof. Jones:

RPaul Johnson told me that you were looking for a C version of Simple -- I
translated Ek's version of Id Simple to C, and have included it in this
message.  To compile, simply:

	gcc -O2 simple.c -o simple -lm

Let me know if you have any problems ... the code is not completely
optimal, but it's a hell of a lot faster than any Id code.  It's also a
fairly cleanly written C program (IMHO).  The results of the code agree
almost exactly with the Id version, which is good, I suppose, even though
no one really knows whether the results of the Id version are correct.

I had not sent it out yet, I want to send you one would be closer
to the Id version and in the ph 1.3 syntax.  I haven't got that one
yet, but, I should soon.

This version may be useful because it is in 1.2 Haskell, I am pretty sure
that it is not very efficient.  I am checking on a C version, would a dusty
deck fortran version interest you?

I think it runs quickly enough, I spent a fair amount of time trying to
eliminate overloading of numeric operations and making the array constructions
strict.  I am working on a pH version, which we can compare directly to
the Id version.

Here is the fortran in its original form from Olaf Lubeck:

I have made a link from our CSG home page to "benchmarks"
  http://www.csg.lcs.mit.edu:8001/benchmarks  

Some of the information you need for the fortran and haskell versions is
there.  A sample input and output for both. When I put this together, I
compared the state arrays that were produced by the haskell and the Id code. 
We will put together the same information for the C version shortly and send
you a note when it is available.

Although the sample run shows a 10x10 after 3 iterations, 
longer runs should use a larger dataset, at least 20x20 or 100x100.
(I have seen a 10x10 at around 120 iterations generate NANs)
