UPDATE(2017.02)
---------------

Currently `make` will run the `holzhausen.prob` (specified in the `Makefile`),
the output is simply copied to `mate.stdout`
(`cp holzhausen.soln mate.stdout`).
If you want to change the benchmark, you need to update both of these.

ORIGINAL README
---------------

Mate solves chess end-game problems of the form "White to move
and mate in N".  For example problems (standard input) and
solutions (standard output) see *.in and *.out.

The program works by brute-force search in an AND-OR game-tree
of depth 2N-1 in which nodes represent board positions and
succession is by legal move.

Here are approximate timings for some of the problems, when
Mate is compiled to byte-code by nhc98 and run on a 700MHz PC
(all times in seconds):

ellerman      3
shinkman     70
fridlizius  140
