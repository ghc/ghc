Kevin,

	Here is the source code of Veritas for you to try to shoehorn onto
GRIP (the parser module downwards is currently being re-written but there
should not be any significant size difference in the object code.)

The file `grip-in' contains sample input for the system. The output consists
of a (human incomprehensible) string of characters. I think you should assume
that if a string is produced and GRIP terminates correctly all is well.
All we are interested in at this stage is GRIPs ability to execute the code
at all.

To compile the system substitute the compiler name in the Makefile and let
it go. It will take a number of hours to compile the whole thing so it could
be an overnight job.

If you want to try the system on a sun3, the file vts90.hs contains a main 
function for this purpose. The existing main function should be renamed main' 
in this case.

I think that's all. Let me know if you need more information.

Good luck
Gareth
