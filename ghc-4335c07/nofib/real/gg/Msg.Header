Kevin,
	Files are sharred up below. The makefile (Ymakefile) will
produce an object gg. The manual for this program is included.
I have also included a script I use called `report' which creates
the GRIP report I showed at the end of the talk. It uses
a file called Report.tex to do this. Don't be surprised
by the amount of time it takes (mind you will be using faster
machine!).

Have fun! (Give us a shout if/when things break.)

Iain.
