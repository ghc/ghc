Simon,

> Can we use your program in our nofib benchmark suite?  Looks fun.

Certainly.  However, I should note that the program is written by
Stef Joosten (joosten@cs.utwente.nl) in Miranda(TM) and I have translated
it to Haskell to play with overloading; I also added the memoising.
The documentation for the program can be found in Stef's Ph.D. thesis
"The use of functional programming in software development."
You can find reference to his thesis in the code.

> Can you supply input and expected output for an "interesting" run?

Most of the input is in the "objects" directory, the file "four.plate"
contains the descriptions of four other files there: table, horse, bookcase
and houses.

An interesting run is:
(echo 2,10,3; echo quit)|hiddenline objects/four.plate > four.2,10,3.ps
To verify the result preview it with
- - xps
  A4 (four.2,10,3.ps)run
- - gs
  (cat four.2,10,3.ps;cat)|gs
or print it on a postscript printer with
  (echo '%\!'; cat four.2,10,3.ps; echo showpage) | lpr

Greetings,
Mark
