    • These kind and type variables: a k (b :: k)
      are out of dependency order. Perhaps try this ordering:
        k (a :: k) (b :: k)
    • In the type signature:
        foo :: forall a k (b :: k). SameKind a b

BadTelescope2.hs:13:8: error:
    • The kind of variable ‘b’, namely ‘Proxy a’,
      depends on variable ‘a’ from an inner scope
      Perhaps bind ‘b’ sometime after binding ‘a’
      NB: Implicitly-bound variables always come before other ones.
    • In the type signature:
        bar :: forall a (c :: Proxy b) (d :: Proxy a).
               Proxy c -> SameKind b d
