drvfail-functor2.hs:1:29: Warning:
    -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

drvfail-functor2.hs:7:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor InFunctionArgument’:
      Constructor ‘InFunctionArgument’ must not use the type variable in a function argument
    In the newtype declaration for ‘InFunctionArgument’

drvfail-functor2.hs:10:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor OnSecondArg’:
      Constructor ‘OnSecondArg’ must use the type variable only as the last argument of a data type
    In the newtype declaration for ‘OnSecondArg’

drvfail-functor2.hs:15:14:
    Cannot derive well-kinded instance of form ‘Functor (NoArguments ...)’
      Class ‘Functor’ expects an argument of kind ‘* -> *’
    In the newtype declaration for ‘NoArguments’

drvfail-functor2.hs:20:14:
    Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor StupidConstraint’:
      Data type ‘StupidConstraint’ must not have a class context: Eq a
    In the data declaration for ‘StupidConstraint’

drvfail-functor2.hs:26:14:
    No instance for (Functor NoFunctor)
      arising from the first field of ‘UseNoFunctor’ (type ‘NoFunctor a’)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Functor UseNoFunctor)
