    • No instance for (Eq a) arising from a use of ‘==’
      Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the instance declaration
    • In the expression: ((a1 == b1))
      In an equation for ‘==’: (==) (T1 a1) (T1 b1) = ((a1 == b1))
      When typechecking the code for ‘==’
        in a derived instance for ‘Eq (T a)’:
        To see the code I am typechecking, use -ddump-deriv
      In the instance declaration for ‘Eq (T a)’
