    Couldn't match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Int’
    arising from a functional dependency between constraints:
      ‘?x::Int’ arising from a use of ‘foo’ at T5246.hs:11:10-12
      ‘?x::[Char]’
        arising from the implicit-parameter binding for ?x
        at T5246.hs:(10,7)-(11,12)
    In the expression: foo
    In the expression: let ?x = "hello" in foo
    In an equation for ‘bar’: bar = let ?x = "hello" in foo
