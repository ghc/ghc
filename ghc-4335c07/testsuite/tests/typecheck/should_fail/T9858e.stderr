    Couldn't match type ‘Eq Int => Int’ with ‘a0 b0’
    Expected type: Proxy (a0 b0)
      Actual type: Proxy (Eq Int => Int)
    In the first argument of ‘i’, namely
      ‘(Proxy :: Proxy (Eq Int => Int))’
    In the expression: i (Proxy :: Proxy (Eq Int => Int))
    In an equation for ‘j’: j = i (Proxy :: Proxy (Eq Int => Int))
