    Couldn't match expected type ‘[Int] -> [Int]’
                with actual type ‘[a1]’
    Possible cause: ‘take’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take x []
    In an equation for ‘f’: f x = take x []

    Couldn't match expected type ‘[Int]’
                with actual type ‘[a0] -> [a0]’
    Probable cause: ‘take’ is applied to too few arguments
    In the expression: take 3
    In an equation for ‘g’: g = take 3
