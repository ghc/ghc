T2714.hs:8:5: error:
    • Couldn't match type ‘c’ with ‘f0 (a -> b)’
      ‘c’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          f :: ((a -> b) -> b) -> forall c. c -> a
        at T2714.hs:8:1-9
      Expected type: ((a -> b) -> b) -> c -> a
        Actual type: ((a -> b) -> b) -> f0 (a -> b) -> f0 b
    • In the expression: ffmap
      In an equation for ‘f’: f = ffmap
    • Relevant bindings include
        f :: ((a -> b) -> b) -> forall c. c -> a (bound at T2714.hs:8:1)
