    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Integer’ with actual type ‘b’
      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          g :: forall b. Num b => b -> b

    • In the first argument of ‘f’, namely ‘x’
      In the expression: f x x
      In an equation for ‘g’: g x = f x x
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: b (bound at tcfail131.hs:7:5)
