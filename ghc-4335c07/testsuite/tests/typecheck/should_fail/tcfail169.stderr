tcfail169.hs:7:51: error:
    • Could not deduce (Show (Succ a))
        arising from the second field of ‘Cons’ (type ‘Seq (Succ a)’)
      from the context: Show a
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘Show (Seq a)’
        at tcfail169.hs:7:51-54
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Show (Seq a))
