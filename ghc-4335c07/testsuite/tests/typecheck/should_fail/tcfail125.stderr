tcfail125.hs:11:4: error:
    • No instance for (Show a) arising from a use of ‘LiftObs’
      Possible fix:
        add (Show a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            f :: forall a. Obs a -> String
    • In the pattern: LiftObs _ _
      In an equation for ‘f’: f (LiftObs _ _) = "yes"
