    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘Proposition a0’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by

      Expected type: [Proposition a0]
        Actual type: [a]
    • In the first argument of ‘Auxiliary’, namely ‘varSet’
      In the first argument of ‘Prop’, namely ‘(Auxiliary varSet)’
      In the expression: Prop (Auxiliary varSet)
