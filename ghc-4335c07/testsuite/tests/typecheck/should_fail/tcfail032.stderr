    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a1 -> Int’ with actual type ‘p’
        because type variable ‘a1’ would escape its scope
      This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
        an expression type signature:
          forall a1. Eq a1 => a1 -> Int
        at tcfail032.hs:14:13-30
    • In the expression: (x :: (Eq a) => a -> Int)
      In an equation for ‘f’: f x = (x :: (Eq a) => a -> Int)
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: p (bound at tcfail032.hs:14:3)
        f :: p -> a -> Int (bound at tcfail032.hs:14:1)
