    • Couldn't match expected type ‘IO a0’
                  with actual type ‘a1 -> IO ()’
    • Probable cause: ‘print’ is applied to too few arguments
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: print
      In the expression:
        do print
           print "Hello"
      In an equation for ‘bar’:
          bar
            = do print
                 print "Hello"
