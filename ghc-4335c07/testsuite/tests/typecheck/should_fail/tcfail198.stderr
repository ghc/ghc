    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a1’ with actual type ‘a’
        because type variable ‘a1’ would escape its scope
      This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
        an expression type signature:
          forall a1. a1

    • In the expression: x :: a
      In the second argument of ‘(++)’, namely ‘[x :: a]’
      In the expression: xs ++ [x :: a]
    • Relevant bindings include
        xs :: [a] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:21)
