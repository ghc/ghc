    • Ambiguous type variables ‘a0’, ‘b1’ arising from a use of ‘f’
      prevents the constraint ‘(C a0 b1)’ from being solved.
      Relevant bindings include x :: a0 (bound at T4921.hs:10:1)
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’, ‘b1’ should be.
      These potential instance exist:

    • In the first argument of ‘fst’, namely ‘f’
      In the expression: fst f
      In an equation for ‘x’: x = fst f
