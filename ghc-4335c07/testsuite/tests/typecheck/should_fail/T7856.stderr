    Couldn't match expected type ‘String -> IO ()’
                with actual type ‘IO ()’
    Possible cause: ‘sequence_’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: sequence_ lst
    In an equation for ‘tmp’:
        tmp
          = sequence_ lst
          where
              lst = [putStrLn "hi"]
