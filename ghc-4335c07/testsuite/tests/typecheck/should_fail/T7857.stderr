    • Could not deduce (PrintfType a0) arising from a use of ‘printf’
      from the context: PrintfArg t

      The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
      These potential instances exist:

        instance [safe] (PrintfArg a, PrintfType r) => PrintfType (a -> r)

    • In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘printf "" i’
      In the expression: f $ printf "" i
      In an equation for ‘g’: g i = f $ printf "" i
