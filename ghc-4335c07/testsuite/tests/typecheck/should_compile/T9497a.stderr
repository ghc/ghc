    • Found hole: _main :: IO ()
      Or perhaps ‘_main’ is mis-spelled, or not in scope
    • In the expression: _main
      In an equation for ‘main’: main = _main
    • Relevant bindings include main :: IO () (bound at T9497a.hs:2:1)
      Valid substitutions include
        mempty :: forall a. Monoid a => a
