    • The Monomorphism Restriction applies to the bindings
      for ‘bar2’, ‘baz2’
        Consider giving them a type signature
    • In an equation for ‘foo’:
          foo
            = bar >> baz >> bar2
            where
                bar, baz :: m Char
                (bar, baz) = c
                (bar2, baz2) = c
