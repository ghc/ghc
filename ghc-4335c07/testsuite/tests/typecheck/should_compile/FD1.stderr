FD1.hs:16:1: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘Int -> Int’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          plus :: forall a. E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
        at FD1.hs:15:1-38
    • The equation(s) for ‘plus’ have two arguments,
      but its type ‘Int -> a’ has only one
    • Relevant bindings include plus :: Int -> a (bound at FD1.hs:16:1)
