    ‘x’ is used in a static form but it is not closed because it
    is not let-bound.

    ‘k’ is used in a static form but it is not closed because it
    uses ‘x’ which is not let-bound.

    ‘g’ is used in a static form but it is not closed because it
    uses ‘h’ which has a non-closed type because it contains the
    type variables: ‘a’
    In the first argument of ‘const’, namely ‘(static (g undefined))’
    In the expression: const (static (g undefined)) (h x)
    In an equation for ‘f2’:
