rnfail033.hs:2:21: error:
    Not in scope: ‘Data.List.map’
    Perhaps you meant one of these:
      ‘Data.List.zip’ (imported from Data.List),
      ‘Data.List.all’ (imported from Data.List),
      ‘Data.List.and’ (imported from Data.List)
    Perhaps you want to remove ‘map’ from the explicit hiding list
    in the import of ‘Data.List’ (rnfail033.hs:3:1-31).
