SafeLang17.hs:8:13:
    Unsafe overlapping instances for Pos [Int]
      arising from a use of ‘res’
    The matching instance is:
      instance [incoherent] [safe] Pos [Int]
        -- Defined at SafeLang17_B.hs:14:10
    It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
    overlap instances from the same module, however it
    overlaps the following instances from different modules:
      instance Pos [a] -- Defined at SafeLang17_A.hs:13:10
    In the expression: res [(1 :: Int)]
    In an equation for ‘r’: r = res [(1 :: Int)]
    In the expression:
      do let r = res ...
         putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show r
         putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show function
