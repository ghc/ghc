SH_Overlap11.hs:1:16: warning: [-Wunsafe]
    ‘SH_Overlap11’ has been inferred as unsafe!
    Reason:
        SH_Overlap11.hs:17:8: warning:
            • Unsafe overlapping instances for C [Int]
                arising from a use of ‘f’
              The matching instance is:
                instance [overlap ok] [safe] C [Int]
                  -- Defined at SH_Overlap11_A.hs:11:3
              It is compiled in a Safe module and as such can only
              overlap instances from the same module, however it
              overlaps the following instances from different modules:
                instance C [a] -- Defined at SH_Overlap11.hs:13:3
            • In the expression: f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
              In an equation for ‘test’: test = f ([1, 2, 3, 4] :: [Int])
