    • Unacceptable result type in foreign declaration:
        Safe Haskell is on, all FFI imports must be in the IO monad
    • When checking declaration:
        foreign import ccall safe "sin" c_sin :: Double -> Double

<interactive>:12:1: error:
    • Variable not in scope: c_sin :: Integer -> t
    • Perhaps you meant ‘c_sin'’ (line 7)
