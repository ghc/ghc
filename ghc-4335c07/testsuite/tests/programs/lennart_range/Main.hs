Some floating constants that are within the floating range
become wrong, e.g.

        1.82173691287639817263897126389712638972163e-300::Double

        -- Lennart

PS.  Maybe you use fromRational as defined in the Prelude?
That won't do.  It is badly broken, tell me if you want
one that works.

main = putStr (shows (1.82173691287639817263897126389712638972163e-300::Double) "\n")
