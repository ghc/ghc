--              GHC 4.04
-- I've been having problems getting GHC to compile some code I'm working
-- on with optimisation (-O) turned on.  Compilation is fine without -O

import Data.List

test es =
  concat (groupBy eq (zip [0..(length es) - 1] es))
  where
  eq a b = (fst a) == (fst b)

main = putStr (show (test [1,2,3,4]))
