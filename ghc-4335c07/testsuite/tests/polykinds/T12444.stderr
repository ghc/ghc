    • Couldn't match type ‘b’ with ‘'Succ (c :+: b)’
      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          foo :: forall (c :: Nat) (b :: Nat).
                 SNat ('Succ c) -> SNat b -> SNat ('Succ (c :+: b))
        at T12444.hs:18:1-55
      Expected type: SNat ('Succ (c :+: b))
        Actual type: SNat b
    • In the expression: x
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo _ x = x
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: SNat b (bound at T12444.hs:19:7)
        foo :: SNat ('Succ c) -> SNat b -> SNat ('Succ (c :+: b))
          (bound at T12444.hs:19:1)
