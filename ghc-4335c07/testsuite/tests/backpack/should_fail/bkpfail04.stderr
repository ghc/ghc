bkpfail04.bkp:7:9: error:
    • Type constructor ‘A’ has conflicting definitions in the module
      and its hsig file
      Main module: data A = A {foo :: Int}
      Hsig file:  data A = A {bar :: Bool}
      The constructors do not match:
        The record label lists for ‘A’ differ
        The types for ‘A’ differ
    • while merging the signatures from:
        • p[A=<A>]:A
        • q[A=<A>]:A
        • ...and the local signature for A
