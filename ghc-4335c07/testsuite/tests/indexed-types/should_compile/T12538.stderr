    • Could not deduce: a' ~ Tagged Int a
      from the context: (TagImpl a a', b ~ DF a')
        bound by the instance declaration at T12538.hs:36:10-46
      ‘a'’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the instance declaration at T12538.hs:36:10-46
      Expected type: a -> b
        Actual type: a -> DF (Tagged Int a)
    • In the expression: DF . tag
      In an equation for ‘df’: df = DF . tag
      In the instance declaration for ‘ToDF a b’
    • Relevant bindings include df :: a -> b (bound at T12538.hs:37:3)
