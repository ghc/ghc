T10806.hs:11:32: error:
    Couldn't match expected type ‘Char -> Bool’
                with actual type ‘IO ()’
    The function ‘print’ is applied to two arguments,
    but its type ‘Char -> IO ()’ has only one
    In the expression: print 'x' 'y'
    In an equation for ‘triggersLoop’:
        triggersLoop (Q _ _) (Q _ _) = print 'x' 'y'
