T7729a.hs:36:26: error:
    • Couldn't match type ‘BasePrimMonad m’ with ‘t0 (BasePrimMonad m)’
      Expected type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a
        Actual type: t0 (BasePrimMonad m) a
      The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    • In the first argument of ‘liftPrim’, namely ‘(lift x)’
      In the expression: liftPrim (lift x)
      In an equation for ‘liftPrim’: liftPrim x = liftPrim (lift x)
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a (bound at T7729a.hs:36:12)
        liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
