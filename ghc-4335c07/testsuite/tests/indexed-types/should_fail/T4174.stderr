    • Couldn't match type ‘b’ with ‘RtsSpinLock’
      ‘b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          testcase :: forall (m :: * -> *) minor n t p a b.
                      Monad m =>
                      m (Field (Way (GHC6'8 minor) n t p) a b)
        at T4174.hs:41:1-63
      Expected type: m (Field (Way (GHC6'8 minor) n t p) a b)
        Actual type: m (Field (WayOf m) SmStep RtsSpinLock)
    • In the expression: sync_large_objects
      In an equation for ‘testcase’: testcase = sync_large_objects
    • Relevant bindings include
        testcase :: m (Field (Way (GHC6'8 minor) n t p) a b)
