T7194.hs:18:35: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘b0’ with actual type ‘F a’
        because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
      This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
        the type signature for:
          g :: forall a. C (F a) => a -> Int
        at T7194.hs:17:18-41
    • In the expression: foo y
      In the first argument of ‘length’, namely ‘[x, foo y]’
      In the expression: length [x, foo y]
    • Relevant bindings include
        y :: a (bound at T7194.hs:18:20)
        g :: a -> Int (bound at T7194.hs:18:18)
        x :: b0 (bound at T7194.hs:17:9)
