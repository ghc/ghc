    The operator ‘:+’ [infixl 6] of a section
        must have lower precedence than that of the operand,
          namely ‘:+’ [infixl 6]
        in the section: ‘:+ N :+ N’
    In the untyped splice:
      $(let
          plus = conE '(:+)
          n = conE 'N
        in infixE Nothing plus (Just $ uInfixE n plus n))
