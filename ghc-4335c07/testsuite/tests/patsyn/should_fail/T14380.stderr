    Invalid right-hand side of bidirectional pattern synonym ‘Bar’:
      Pattern ‘[]’ is not invertible
      Suggestion: instead use an explicitly bidirectional pattern synonym, e.g.
        pattern Bar <- Foo [] where Bar = ...
      Reason: rebindable syntax is on.
      This is fixable: add use-case to Trac #14380
    RHS pattern: Foo []
