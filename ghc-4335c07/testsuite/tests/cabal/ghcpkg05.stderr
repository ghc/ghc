  import-dirs: /usr/local/lib/testpkg doesn't exist or isn't a directory
  import-dirs: c:/Program Files/testpkg is a relative path which makes no sense (as there is nothing for it to be relative to). You can make paths relative to the package database itself by using ${pkgroot}.

ghc-pkg: unregistering would break the following packages: testpkg-3.0 (use --force to override)
