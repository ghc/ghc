   throwToSelf

   Useful for throwing an async exception in a thread from the
   runtime.  It handles unlocking the throwto message returned by
   throwTo().

   Note [Throw to self when masked]
   
   When a StackOverflow occurs when the thread is masked, we want to
   defer the exception to when the thread becomes unmasked/hits an
   interruptible point.  We already have a mechanism for doing this,
   the blocked_exceptions list, but the use here is a bit unusual,
   because an exception is normally only added to this list upon
   an asynchronous 'throwTo' call (with all of the relevant
   multithreaded nonsense). Morally, a stack overflow should be an
   asynchronous exception sent by a thread to itself, and it should
   have the same semantics.  But there are a few key differences:
   
   - If you actually tried to send an asynchronous exception to
     yourself using throwTo, the exception would actually immediately
     be delivered.  This is because throwTo itself is considered an
     interruptible point, so the exception is always deliverable. Thus,
     ordinarily, we never end up with a message to oneself in the
     blocked_exceptions queue.
   
   - In the case of a StackOverflow, we don't actually care about the
     wakeup semantics; when an exception is delivered, the thread that
     originally threw the exception should be woken up, since throwTo
     blocks until the exception is successfully thrown.  Fortunately,
     it is harmless to wakeup a thread that doesn't actually need waking
     up, e.g. ourselves.
   
   - No synchronization is necessary, because we own the TSO and the
     capability.  You can observe this by tracing through the execution
     of throwTo.  We skip synchronizing the message and inter-capability
     communication.
   
   We think this doesn't break any invariants, but do be careful!
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

throwToSelf (Capability *cap, StgTSO *tso, StgClosure *exception)

    MessageThrowTo *m;

/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   throwTo

   This function may be used to throw an exception from one thread to
   another, during the course of normal execution.  This is a tricky
   task: the target thread might be running on another CPU, or it
   may be blocked and could be woken up at any point by another CPU.
   We have some delicate synchronisation to do.

   The underlying scheme when multiple Capabilities are in use is
   message passing: when the target of a throwTo is on another
   Capability, we send a message (a MessageThrowTo closure) to that
   Capability.

   If the throwTo needs to block because the target TSO is masking
   exceptions (the TSO_BLOCKEX flag), then the message is placed on
   the blocked_exceptions queue attached to the target TSO.  When the
   target TSO enters the unmasked state again, it must check the
   queue.  The blocked_exceptions queue is not locked; only the
   Capability owning the TSO may modify it.

   To make things simpler for throwTo, we always create the message
   first before deciding what to do.  The message may get sent, or it
   may get attached to a TSO's blocked_exceptions queue, or the
   exception may get thrown immediately and the message dropped,
   depending on the current state of the target.

   Currently we send a message if the target belongs to another
   Capability, and it is

     - NotBlocked, BlockedOnMsgThrowTo,
       BlockedOnCCall_Interruptible

     - or it is masking exceptions (TSO_BLOCKEX)

   Currently, if the target is BlockedOnMVar, BlockedOnSTM, or
   BlockedOnBlackHole then we acquire ownership of the TSO by locking
   its parent container (e.g. the MVar) and then raise the exception.
   We might change these cases to be more message-passing-like in the
   future.

   Returns:

   NULL               exception was raised, ok to continue

   MessageThrowTo *   exception was not raised; the source TSO
                      should now put itself in the state
                      BlockedOnMsgThrowTo, and when it is ready
                      it should unlock the mssage using
                      unlockClosure(msg, &stg_MSG_THROWTO_info);
                      If it decides not to raise the exception after
                      all, it can revoke it safely with
                      unlockClosure(msg, &stg_MSG_NULL_info);

/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * raiseAsync()
 *
 * The following function implements the magic for raising an
 * asynchronous exception in an existing thread.
 *
 * We first remove the thread from any queue on which it might be
 * blocked.  The possible blockages are MVARs, BLOCKING_QUEUESs, and
 * TSO blocked_exception queues.
 *
 * We strip the stack down to the innermost CATCH_FRAME, building
 * thunks in the heap for all the active computations, so they can
 * be restarted if necessary.  When we reach a CATCH_FRAME, we build
 * an application of the handler to the exception, and push it on
 * the top of the stack.
 *
 * How exactly do we save all the active computations?  We create an
 * AP_STACK for every UpdateFrame on the stack.  Entering one of these
 * AP_STACKs pushes everything from the corresponding update frame
 * upwards onto the stack.  (Actually, it pushes everything up to the
 * next update frame plus a pointer to the next AP_STACK object.
 * Entering the next AP_STACK object pushes more onto the stack until we
 * reach the last AP_STACK object - at which point the stack should look
 * exactly as it did when we killed the TSO and we can continue
 * execution by entering the closure on top of the stack.
 *
 * We can also kill a thread entirely - this happens if either (a) the
 * exception passed to raiseAsync is NULL, or (b) there's no
 * CATCH_FRAME on the stack.  In either case, we strip the entire
 * stack and replace the thread with a zombie.
 *
 * ToDo: in THREADED_RTS mode, this function is only safe if either
 * (a) we hold all the Capabilities (eg. in GC, or if there is only
 * one Capability), or (b) we own the Capability that the TSO is
 * currently blocked on or on the run queue of.
