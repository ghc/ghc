   General scheme

   ToDo: move this to the wiki when the implementation is done.

   We're only going to try to parallelise the copying GC for now.  The
   Plan is as follows.

   Each thread has a gc_thread structure (see below) which holds its
   thread-local data.  We'll keep a pointer to this in a thread-local
   variable, or possibly in a register.

   In the gc_thread structure is a gen_workspace for each generation.  The
   primary purpose of the gen_workspace is to hold evacuated objects;
   when an object is evacuated, it is copied to the "todo" block in
   the thread's workspace for the appropriate generation.  When the todo
   block is full, it is pushed to the global gen->todos list, which
   is protected by a lock.  (in fact we intervene a one-place buffer
   here to reduce contention).

   A thread repeatedly grabs a block of work from one of the
   gen->todos lists, scavenges it, and keeps the scavenged block on
   its own ws->scavd_list (this is to avoid unnecessary contention
   returning the completed buffers back to the generation: we can just
   collect them all later).

   When there is no global work to do, we start scavenging the todo
   blocks in the workspaces.  This is where the scan_bd field comes
   in: we can scan the contents of the todo block, when we have
   scavenged the contents of the todo block (up to todo_bd->free), we
   don't want to move this block immediately to the scavd_list,
   because it is probably only partially full.  So we remember that we
   have scanned up to this point by saving the block in ws->scan_bd,
   with the current scan pointer in ws->scan.  Later, when more
   objects have been copied to this block, we can come back and scan
   the rest.  When we visit this workspace again in the future,
   scan_bd may still be the same as todo_bd, or it might be different:
   if enough objects were copied into this block that it filled up,
   then we will have allocated a new todo block, but *not* pushed the
   old one to the generation, because it is partially scanned.

   The reason to leave scanning the todo blocks until last is that we
   want to deal with full blocks as far as possible.

/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Generation Workspace

   A generation workspace exists for each generation for each GC
   thread. The GC thread takes a block from the todos list of the
   generation into the scanbd and then scans it.  Objects referred to
   by those in the scan block are copied into the todo or scavd blocks
   of the relevant generation.

   Every GC thread has one of these. It contains all the generation
   specific workspaces and other GC thread local information. At some
   later point it maybe useful to move this other into the TLS store
