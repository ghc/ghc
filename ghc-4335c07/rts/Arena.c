   Arena allocation.  Arenas provide fast memory allocation at the
   expense of fine-grained recycling of storage: memory may be
   only be returned to the system by freeing the entire arena, it
   isn't possible to return individual objects within an arena.

   Do not assume that sequentially allocated objects will be adjacent
   in memory.

   Quirks: this allocator makes use of the RTS block allocator.  If
   the current block doesn't have enough room for the requested
   object, then a new block is allocated.  This means that allocating
   large objects will tend to result in wasted space at the end of
   each block.  In the worst case, half of the allocated space is
   wasted.  This allocator is therefore best suited to situations in
   which most allocations are small.
