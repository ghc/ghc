/* When loading sections of the macho

 * pages can be marked r+x for text and
 * r+w for data, relocation may need
 * to be done indirectly, as the symbol
 * is not within reach of the of the
 * call site. E.g. B/BL instructions on
 * aarch64 have +-128mb relative
 * range.  When pages are mmap'd they
 * may end up at random positions.
 *
 * Hence we reserve space for the stub
 * slots right after the text section
 *
 *  .----------. - page start
 *  |          |
 *  |  __TEXT  |
 *  |          |
 *  |----------|
 *  |  Stubs   |
 *  '----------'
 *
 * Therefore, unless the __TEXT section
 * grows beyond 128mb-|Stubs|, we can
 * always reach the corresponding stub
 * for a symbol.
 *
 * Stubs will be rendered as
 * - 8 bytes: target address
 * - 4 bytes: relative load at -8bytes
 instruction
 * - 4 bytes: branch instruction
 *
 * These are very similar to the SymbolExtras
 * below.  However the SymbolExtras are allocated
 * per ObjectCode and not per Section.
 *
 * TODO: Merge SymbolExtras and Stubs.
