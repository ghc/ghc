Here is a set of small programs useful for visually inspecting
that fusion has worked. Many of them have decent runtimes that will
explode if fusion fails.

In addition, there is a script, ./Test, that will check the entire suite
against expected rule firings.

The Test.hs file will need to be updated if you add new fusion rules.
