--
-- A 'TQueue' is like a 'TChan', with two important differences:
--
--  * it has faster throughput than both 'TChan' and 'Chan' (although
--    the costs are amortised, so the cost of individual operations
--    can vary a lot).
--
--  * it does /not/ provide equivalents of the 'dupTChan' and
--    'cloneTChan' operations.
--
-- The implementation is based on the traditional purely-functional
-- queue representation that uses two lists to obtain amortised /O(1)/
-- enqueue and dequeue operations.
