Adding trivially true invariant (no TVar access)

Adding a trivially true invariant (TVar access)

Adding an invariant that's false when attempted to be added
Caught: URK

Writing to a TVar watched by a trivially true invariant

Adding a second trivially true invariant (same TVar access)

Writing to a TVar watched by both trivially true invariants

Adding a trivially false invariant (no TVar access)
Caught: Exn raised in invariant

Adding a trivially false invariant (no TVar access)
Caught: Exn raised in invariant

Adding a trivially false invariant (no TVar access)
Caught: Transactional invariant violation

Adding a trivially false invariant (with TVar access)
Caught: Exn raised in invariant

Adding a third invariant true if TVar != 42

Violating third invariant by setting TVar to 42
Caught: Exn raised in invariant

Checking final TVar contents
Final value = 18

Done
