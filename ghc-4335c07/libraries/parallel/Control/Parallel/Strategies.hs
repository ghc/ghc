-- Parallel Evaluation Strategies, or Strategies for short, provide
-- ways to express parallel computations.  Strategies have the following
-- key features:
--
--  * Strategies express /deterministic parallelism/:
--    the result of the program is unaffected by evaluating in parallel.
--    The parallel tasks evaluated by a Strategy may have no side effects.
--    For non-deterministic parallel programming, see "Control.Concurrent".
--
--  * Strategies let you separate the description of the parallelism from the
--    logic of your program, enabling modular parallelism.  The basic idea
--    is to build a lazy data structure representing the computation, and
--    then write a Strategy that describes how to traverse the data structure
--    and evaluate components of it sequentially or in parallel.
--
--  * Strategies are /compositional/: larger strategies can be built
--    by gluing together smaller ones.
--
--  * 'Monad' and 'Applicative' instances are provided, for quickly building
--    strategies that involve traversing structures in a regular way.
--
-- For API history and changes in this release, see "Control.Parallel.Strategies#history".

-- Eval monad (isomorphic to Lift monad from MonadLib 3.6.1)

-- | 'Eval' is a Monad that makes it easier to define parallel
-- strategies.  It is a strict identity monad: that is, in
--
--  > m >>= f
--
-- @m@ is evaluated before the result is passed to @f@.
--
--  > instance Monad Eval where
--  >   return  = Done
--  >   m >>= k = case m of
--  >               Done x -> k x
--
-- If you wanted to construct a 'Strategy' for a pair that sparked the
-- first component in parallel and then evaluated the second
-- component, you could write
--
-- > myStrat :: Strategy (a,b)
-- > myStrat (a,b) = do { a' <- rpar a; b' <- rseq b; return (a',b') }
--
-- Alternatively, you could write this more compactly using the
-- Applicative style as
--
-- > myStrat (a,b) = (,) <$> rpar a <*> rseq b

-- More examples, using the Applicative instance:
--
-- > parList :: Strategy a -> Strategy [a]
-- > parList strat = traverse (rpar `dot` strat))

-- Strategies

-- | A 'Strategy' is a function that embodies a parallel evaluation strategy.
-- The function traverses (parts of) its argument, evaluating subexpressions
-- in parallel or in sequence.
--
-- A 'Strategy' may do an arbitrary amount of evaluation of its
-- argument, but should not return a value different from the one it
-- was passed.
--
-- Parallel computations may be discarded by the runtime system if the
-- program no longer requires their result, which is why a 'Strategy'
-- function returns a new value equivalent to the old value.  The
-- intention is that the program applies the 'Strategy' to a
-- structure, and then uses the returned value, discarding the old
-- value.  This idiom is expressed by the 'using' function.
--
type Strategy a = a -> Eval a

-- | Evaluate a value using the given 'Strategy'.
--
-- > x `using` s = runEval (s x)
--
using :: a -> Strategy a -> a
x `using` strat = runEval (strat x)

-- | evaluate a value using the given 'Strategy'.  This is simply
-- 'using' with the arguments reversed.
--
withStrategy :: Strategy a -> a -> a
withStrategy = flip using

-- | Compose two strategies sequentially.
-- This is the analogue to function composition on strategies.
--
-- > strat2 `dot` strat1 == strat2 . withStrategy strat1
--
dot :: Strategy a -> Strategy a -> Strategy a
strat2 `dot` strat1 = strat2 . runEval . strat1

-- Proof of strat2 `dot` strat1 == strat2 . withStrategy strat1
--
--    strat2 . withStrategy strat1
-- == \x -> strat2 (withStrategy strat1 x)
-- == \x -> strat2 (x `using` strat1)
-- == \x -> strat2 (runEval (strat1 x))
-- == \x -> (strat2 . runEval . strat1) x
-- == strat2 `dot` strat1

-- One might be tempted to think that 'dot' is equivalent to '(<=<)',
-- the right-to-left Kleisli composition in the Eval monad, because
-- '(<=<)' can take the type @Strategy a -> Strategy a -> Strategy a@
-- and intuitively does what 'dot' does: First apply the strategy to the
-- right then the one to the left. However, there is a subtle difference
-- in strictness, witnessed by the following example:
--
-- > (r0 `dot` rseq) undefined == Done undefined
-- > (r0 <=< rseq) undefined == undefined

{- $history #history#

The strategies library has a long history.  What follows is a
summary of how the current design evolved, and is mostly of
interest to those who are familiar with an older version, or need
to adapt old code to use the newer API.

Version 1.x

  The original Strategies design is described in /Algorithm + Strategy = Parallelism/ <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gph/papers/html/Strategies/strategies.html>
  and the code was written by
     Phil Trinder, Hans-Wolfgang Loidl, Kevin Hammond et al.

Version 2.x

Later, during work on the shared-memory implementation of
parallelism in GHC, we discovered that the original formulation of
Strategies had some problems, in particular it lead to space leaks
and difficulties expressing speculative parallelism.  Details are in
the paper /Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell/ <http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/multicore-ghc.pdf>.

This module has been rewritten in version 2. The main change is to
the 'Strategy a' type synonym, which was previously @a -> Done@ and
is now @a -> Eval a@.  This change helps to fix the space leak described
in \"Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell\".  The problem is that
the runtime will currently retain the memory referenced by all
sparks, until they are evaluated.  Hence, we must arrange to
evaluate all the sparks eventually, just in case they aren't
evaluated in parallel, so that they don't cause a space leak.  This
is why we must return a \"new\" value after applying a 'Strategy',
so that the application can evaluate each spark created by the
'Strategy'.

The simple rule is this: you /must/ use the result of applying
a 'Strategy' if the strategy creates parallel sparks, and you
should probably discard the the original value.  If you don't
do this, currently it may result in a space leak.  In the
future (GHC 6.14), it will probably result in lost parallelism
instead, as we plan to change GHC so that unreferenced sparks
are discarded rather than retained (we can't make this change
until most code is switched over to this new version of
Strategies, because code using the old verison of Strategies
would be broken by the change in policy).

The other changes in version 2.x are:

  * Strategies can now be defined using a convenient Monad/Applicative
    type, 'Eval'.  e.g. @parList s = traverse (Par . (``using`` s))@

  * 'parList' has been generalised to 'parTraverse', which works on
    any 'Traversable' type, and similarly 'seqList' has been generalised
    to 'seqTraverse'

  * 'parList' and 'parBuffer' have versions specialised to 'rwhnf',
    and there are transformation rules that automatically translate
    e.g. @parList rwnhf@ into a call to the optimised version.

  * 'NFData' has been moved to @Control.DeepSeq@ in the @deepseq@
    package.  Note that since the 'Strategy' type changed, 'rnf'
    is no longer a 'Strategy': use 'rdeepseq' instead.

Version 2.1 moved NFData into a separate package, @deepseq@.

Version 2.2 changed the type of Strategy to @a -> Eval a@, and
re-introduced the @r0@ strategy which was missing in version 2.1.

Version 2.3 simplified the @Eval@ type, so that @Eval@ is now just
the strict identity monad.  This change and various other
improvements and refactorings are thanks to Patrick Maier who
noticed that @Eval@ didn't satisfy the monad laws, and that a
simpler version would fix that problem.

(version 2.3 was not released on Hackage).

Version 3 introduced a major overhaul of the API, to match what is
presented in the paper

  /Seq no More: Better Strategies for Parallel Haskell/
  <http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/strategies.pdf>

The major differences in the API are:

 * The addition of Sequential strategies ("Control.Seq") as
   a composable means for specifying sequential evaluation.

 * Changes to the naming scheme: 'rwhnf' renamed to 'rseq',
   'seqList' renamed to 'evalList', 'seqPair' renamed to
   'evalTuple2',

The naming scheme is now as follows:

  * Basic polymorphic strategies (of type @'Strategy' a@) are called @r...@.
    Examples: 'r0', 'rseq', 'rpar', 'rdeepseq'.

  * A strategy combinator for a particular type constructor
    or constructor class @T@ is called @evalT...@, @parT...@ or @seqT...@.

  * The @seqT...@ combinators (residing in module
     "Control.Seq") yield sequential strategies.
     Thus, @seqT...@ combinators cannot spark, nor can the sequential
     strategies to which they may be applied.
     Examples: 'seqTuple2', 'seqListN', 'seqFoldable'.

  * The @evalT...@ combinators do not spark themselves, yet they may
     be applied to strategies that do spark. (They may also be applied
     to non-sparking strategies; however, in that case the corresponding
     @seqT...@ combinator might be a better choice.)
     Examples: 'evalTuple2', 'evalListN', 'evalTraversable'.

  * The @parT...@ combinators, which are derived from their @evalT...@
     counterparts, do spark. They may be applied to all strategies,
     whether sparking or not.
     Examples: 'parTuple2', 'parListN', 'parTraversable'.

  * An exception to the type driven naming scheme are 'evalBuffer' and
     'parBuffer', which are not named after their type constructor (lists)
     but after their function (rolling buffer of fixed size).
