{- $matching_overloaded_methods_in_rules

Matching on class methods (e.g. @(==)@) in rewrite rules tends to be a bit
fragile. For instance, consider this motivating example from the @bytestring@
library,

> break :: (Word8 -> Bool) -> ByteString -> (ByteString, ByteString)
> breakByte :: Word8 -> ByteString -> (ByteString, ByteString)
> {-# RULES "break -> breakByte" forall a. break (== x) = breakByte x #-}

Here we have two functions, with @breakByte@ providing an optimized
implementation of @break@ where the predicate is merely testing for equality
with a known @Word8@. As written, however, this rule will be quite fragile as
the @(==)@ class operation rule may rewrite the predicate before our @break@
rule has a chance to fire.

For this reason, most of the primitive types in @base@ have 'Eq' and 'Ord'
instances defined in terms of helper functions with inlinings delayed to phase
1. For instance, @Word8@\'s @Eq@ instance looks like,

> instance Eq Word8 where
>     (==) = eqWord8
>     (/=) = neWord8
>
> eqWord8, neWord8 :: Word8 -> Word8 -> Bool
> eqWord8 (W8# x) (W8# y) = ...
> neWord8 (W8# x) (W8# y) = ...
> {-# INLINE [1] eqWord8 #-}
> {-# INLINE [1] neWord8 #-}

This allows us to save our @break@ rule above by rewriting it to instead match
against @eqWord8@,

> {-# RULES "break -> breakByte" forall a. break (`eqWord8` x) = breakByte x #-}

Currently this is only done for '(==)', '(/=)', '(<)', '(<=)', '(>)', and '(>=)'
for the types in "GHC.Word" and "GHC.Int".
