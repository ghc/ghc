@Main.main@ in your program.  When your program is run, the I\/O will
be performed.  It isn't possible to perform I\/O from an arbitrary
function, unless that function is itself in the 'IO' monad and called
at some point, directly or indirectly, from @Main.main@.

'IO' is a monad, so 'IO' actions can be combined using either the do-notation
or the '>>' and '>>=' operations from the 'Monad' class.

Note [Kind-changing of (~) and Coercible]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(~) and Coercible are tricky to define. To the user, they must appear as
constraints, but we cannot define them as such in Haskell. But we also cannot
just define them only in GHC.Prim (like (->)), because we need a real module
for them, e.g. to compile the constructor's info table.

Furthermore the type of MkCoercible cannot be written in Haskell
(no syntax for ~#R).

So we define them as regular data types in GHC.Types, and do magic in TysWiredIn,
inside GHC, to change the kind and type.
-}


-- | Lifted, heterogeneous equality. By lifted, we mean that it
-- can be bogus (deferred type error). By heterogeneous, the two
-- types @a@ and @b@ might have different kinds. Because @~~@ can
-- appear unexpectedly in error messages to users who do not care
-- about the difference between heterogeneous equality @~~@ and
-- homogeneous equality @~@, this is printed as @~@ unless
-- @-fprint-equality-relations@ is set.
class a ~~ b
  -- See also Note [The equality types story] in TysPrim

-- | @Coercible@ is a two-parameter class that has instances for types @a@ and @b@ if
--      the compiler can infer that they have the same representation. This class
--      does not have regular instances; instead they are created on-the-fly during
--      type-checking. Trying to manually declare an instance of @Coercible@
--      is an error.
--
--      Nevertheless one can pretend that the following three kinds of instances
--      exist. First, as a trivial base-case:
--
--      @instance Coercible a a@
--
--      Furthermore, for every type constructor there is
--      an instance that allows to coerce under the type constructor. For
--      example, let @D@ be a prototypical type constructor (@data@ or
--      @newtype@) with three type arguments, which have roles @nominal@,
--      @representational@ resp. @phantom@. Then there is an instance of
--      the form
--
--      @instance Coercible b b\' => Coercible (D a b c) (D a b\' c\')@
--
--      Note that the @nominal@ type arguments are equal, the
--      @representational@ type arguments can differ, but need to have a
--      @Coercible@ instance themself, and the @phantom@ type arguments can be
--      changed arbitrarily.
--
--      The third kind of instance exists for every @newtype NT = MkNT T@ and
--      comes in two variants, namely
--
--      @instance Coercible a T => Coercible a NT@
--
--      @instance Coercible T b => Coercible NT b@
--
--      This instance is only usable if the constructor @MkNT@ is in scope.
--
--      If, as a library author of a type constructor like @Set a@, you
--      want to prevent a user of your module to write
--      @coerce :: Set T -> Set NT@,
--      you need to set the role of @Set@\'s type parameter to @nominal@,
--      by writing
--
--      @type role Set nominal@

isTrue# :: Int# -> Bool   -- See Note [Optimizing isTrue#]
isTrue# x = tagToEnum# x

{- Note [Optimizing isTrue#]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Current definition of isTrue# is a temporary workaround. We would like to
have functions isTrue# and isFalse# defined like this:

    isTrue# :: Int# -> Bool
    isTrue# 1# = True
    isTrue# _  = False

    isFalse# :: Int# -> Bool
    isFalse# 0# = True
    isFalse# _  = False

These functions would allow us to safely check if a tag can represent True
or False. Using isTrue# and isFalse# as defined above will not introduce
additional case into the code. When we scrutinize return value of isTrue#
or isFalse#, either explicitly in a case expression or implicitly in a guard,
the result will always be a single case expression (given that optimizations
are turned on). This results from case-of-case transformation. Consider this
code (this is both valid Haskell and Core):

case isTrue# (a ># b) of
    True  -> e1
    False -> e2

Inlining isTrue# gives:

case (case (a ># b) of { 1# -> True; _ -> False } ) of
    True  -> e1
    False -> e2

Case-of-case transforms that to:

case (a ># b) of
  1# -> case True of
          True  -> e1
          False -> e2
  _  -> case False of
          True  -> e1
          False -> e2

Which is then simplified by case-of-known-constructor:

case (a ># b) of
  1# -> e1
  _  -> e2

While we get good Core here, the code generator will generate very bad Cmm
if e1 or e2 do allocation. It will push heap checks into case alternatives
which results in about 2.5% increase in code size. Until this is improved we
just make isTrue# an alias to tagToEnum#. This is a temporary solution (if
you're reading this in 2023 then things went wrong). See #8326.

{- Note [Runtime representation of modules and tycons]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We generate a binding for M.$modName and M.$tcT for every module M and
data type T.  Things to think about

  - We want them to be economical on space; ideally pure data with no thunks.

  - We do this for every module (except this module GHC.Types), so we can't
    depend on anything else (eg string unpacking code)

That's why we have these terribly low-level representations.  The TrName
type lets us use the TrNameS constructor when allocating static data;
but we also need TrNameD for the case where we are deserialising a TyCon
or Module (for example when deserialising a TypeRep), in which case we
can't conveniently come up with an Addr#.
