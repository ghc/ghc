-- The IO Monad

{-
The IO Monad is just an instance of the ST monad, where the state is
the real world.  We use the exception mechanism (in GHC.Exception) to
implement IO exceptions.

NOTE: The IO representation is deeply wired in to various parts of the
system.  The following list may or may not be exhaustive:

Compiler  - types of various primitives in PrimOp.hs

RTS       - forceIO (StgStartup.cmm)
          - catchzh_fast, (un)?blockAsyncExceptionszh_fast, raisezh_fast
            (Exception.cmm)
          - raiseAsync (RaiseAsync.c)

Prelude   - GHC.IO.hs, and several other places including
            GHC.Exception.hs.

Libraries - parts of hslibs/lang.

-- Primitive catch and throwIO

{-
catchException/catch used to handle the passing around of the state to the
action and the handler.  This turned out to be a bad idea - it meant
that we had to wrap both arguments in thunks so they could be entered
as normal (remember IO returns an unboxed pair...).

Now catch# has type

    catch# :: IO a -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a

(well almost; the compiler doesn't know about the IO newtype so we
have to work around that in the definition of catch below).
-}

-- | Catch an exception in the 'IO' monad.
--
-- Note that this function is /strict/ in the action. That is,
-- @catchException undefined b == _|_@. See #exceptions_and_strictness#
-- for details.
catchException :: Exception e => IO a -> (e -> IO a) -> IO a
catchException !io handler = catch io handler

-- | This is the simplest of the exception-catching functions.  It
-- takes a single argument, runs it, and if an exception is raised
-- the \"handler\" is executed, with the value of the exception passed as an
-- argument.  Otherwise, the result is returned as normal.  For example:
--
-- >   catch (readFile f)
-- >         (\e -> do let err = show (e :: IOException)
-- >                   hPutStr stderr ("Warning: Couldn't open " ++ f ++ ": " ++ err)
-- >                   return "")
--
-- Note that we have to give a type signature to @e@, or the program
-- will not typecheck as the type is ambiguous. While it is possible
-- to catch exceptions of any type, see the section \"Catching all
-- exceptions\" (in "Control.Exception") for an explanation of the problems with doing so.
--
-- For catching exceptions in pure (non-'IO') expressions, see the
-- function 'evaluate'.
--
-- Note that due to Haskell\'s unspecified evaluation order, an
-- expression may throw one of several possible exceptions: consider
-- the expression @(error \"urk\") + (1 \`div\` 0)@.  Does
-- the expression throw
-- @ErrorCall \"urk\"@, or @DivideByZero@?
--
-- The answer is \"it might throw either\"; the choice is
-- non-deterministic. If you are catching any type of exception then you
-- might catch either. If you are calling @catch@ with type
-- @IO Int -> (ArithException -> IO Int) -> IO Int@ then the handler may
-- get run with @DivideByZero@ as an argument, or an @ErrorCall \"urk\"@
-- exception may be propogated further up. If you call it again, you
-- might get a the opposite behaviour. This is ok, because 'catch' is an
-- 'IO' computation.

mplusIO :: IO a -> IO a -> IO a
mplusIO m n = m `catchException` \ (_ :: IOError) -> n

-- | A variant of 'throw' that can only be used within the 'IO' monad.
--
-- Although 'throwIO' has a type that is an instance of the type of 'throw', the
-- two functions are subtly different:
--
-- > throw e   `seq` x  ===> throw e
-- > throwIO e `seq` x  ===> x
--
-- The first example will cause the exception @e@ to be raised,
-- whereas the second one won\'t.  In fact, 'throwIO' will only cause
-- an exception to be raised when it is used within the 'IO' monad.
-- The 'throwIO' variant should be used in preference to 'throw' to
-- raise an exception within the 'IO' monad because it guarantees
-- ordering with respect to other 'IO' operations, whereas 'throw'
-- does not.

-- no need to worry about re-enabling asynchronous exceptions; that is
-- done automatically on exiting the scope of
-- 'block'.
--
-- Threads created by 'Control.Concurrent.forkIO' inherit the blocked
-- state from the parent; that is, to start a thread in blocked mode,
-- use @block $ forkIO ...@.  This is particularly useful if you need to
-- establish an exception handler in the forked thread before any
-- asynchronous exceptions are received.

-- | Executes an IO computation with asynchronous
-- exceptions /masked/.  That is, any thread which attempts to raise
-- an exception in the current thread with 'Control.Exception.throwTo'
-- will be blocked until asynchronous exceptions are unmasked again.
--
-- The argument passed to 'mask' is a function that takes as its
-- argument another function, which can be used to restore the
-- prevailing masking state within the context of the masked
-- computation.  For example, a common way to use 'mask' is to protect
-- the acquisition of a resource:
--
-- > mask $ \restore -> do
-- >     x <- acquire
-- >     restore (do_something_with x) `onException` release
-- >     release
--
-- This code guarantees that @acquire@ is paired with @release@, by masking
-- asynchronous exceptions for the critical parts. (Rather than write
-- this code yourself, it would be better to use
-- 'Control.Exception.bracket' which abstracts the general pattern).
--
-- Note that the @restore@ action passed to the argument to 'mask'
-- does not necessarily unmask asynchronous exceptions, it just
-- restores the masking state to that of the enclosing context.  Thus
-- if asynchronous exceptions are already masked, 'mask' cannot be used
-- to unmask exceptions again.  This is so that if you call a library function
-- with exceptions masked, you can be sure that the library call will not be
-- able to unmask exceptions again.  If you are writing library code and need
-- to use asynchronous exceptions, the only way is to create a new thread;
-- see 'Control.Concurrent.forkIOWithUnmask'.
--
-- Asynchronous exceptions may still be received while in the masked
-- state if the masked thread /blocks/ in certain ways; see
-- "Control.Exception#interruptible".
--
-- Threads created by 'Control.Concurrent.forkIO' inherit the
-- 'MaskingState' from the parent; that is, to start a thread in the
-- 'MaskedInterruptible' state,
-- use @mask_ $ forkIO ...@.  This is particularly useful if you need
-- to establish an exception handler in the forked thread before any
-- asynchronous exceptions are received.  To create a a new thread in
-- an unmasked state use 'Control.Concurrent.forkIOWithUnmask'.

-- | Evaluate the argument to weak head normal form.
--
-- 'evaluate' is typically used to uncover any exceptions that a lazy value
-- may contain, and possibly handle them.
--
-- 'evaluate' only evaluates to /weak head normal form/. If deeper
-- evaluation is needed, the @force@ function from @Control.DeepSeq@
-- may be handy:
--
-- > evaluate $ force x
--
-- There is a subtle difference between @'evaluate' x@ and @'return' '$!' x@,
-- analogous to the difference between 'throwIO' and 'throw'. If the lazy
-- value @x@ throws an exception, @'return' '$!' x@ will fail to return an
-- 'IO' action and will throw an exception instead. @'evaluate' x@, on the
-- other hand, always produces an 'IO' action; that action will throw an
-- exception upon /execution/ iff @x@ throws an exception upon /evaluation/.
--
-- The practical implication of this difference is that due to the
-- /imprecise exceptions/ semantics,
--
-- > (return $! error "foo") >> error "bar"
--
-- may throw either @"foo"@ or @"bar"@, depending on the optimizations
-- performed by the compiler. On the other hand,
--
-- > evaluate (error "foo") >> error "bar"
--
-- is guaranteed to throw @"foo"@.
--
-- The rule of thumb is to use 'evaluate' to force or handle exceptions in
-- lazy values. If, on the other hand, you are forcing a lazy value for
-- efficiency reasons only and do not care about exceptions, you may
-- use @'return' '$!' x@.
evaluate :: a -> IO a
evaluate a = IO $ \s -> seq# a s -- NB. see #2273, #5129

{- $exceptions_and_strictness

Laziness can interact with @catch@-like operations in non-obvious ways (see,
e.g. GHC Trac #11555 and #13330). For instance, consider these subtly-different
examples:

> test1 = Control.Exception.catch (error "uh oh") (\(_ :: SomeException) -> putStrLn "it failed")
>
> test2 = GHC.IO.catchException (error "uh oh") (\(_ :: SomeException) -> putStrLn "it failed")

While @test1@ will print "it failed", @test2@ will print "uh oh".

When using 'catchException', exceptions thrown while evaluating the
action-to-be-executed will not be caught; only exceptions thrown during
execution of the action will be handled by the exception handler.

Since this strictness is a small optimization and may lead to surprising
results, all of the @catch@ and @handle@ variants offered by "Control.Exception"
use 'catch' rather than 'catchException'.
