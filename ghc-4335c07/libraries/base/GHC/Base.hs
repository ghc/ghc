NOTA BENE: Do NOT use ($) anywhere in this module! The type of ($) is
slightly magical (it can return unlifted types), and it is wired in.
But, it is also *defined* in this module, with a non-magical type.
GHC gets terribly confused (and *hangs*) if you try to use ($) in this
module, because it has different types in different scenarios.

This is not a problem in general, because the type ($), being wired in, is not
written out to the interface file, so importing files don't get confused.
The problem is only if ($) is used here. So don't!

---------------------------------------------

The overall structure of the GHC Prelude is a bit tricky.

  a) We want to avoid "orphan modules", i.e. ones with instance
        decls that don't belong either to a tycon or a class
        defined in the same module

  b) We want to avoid giant modules

So the rough structure is as follows, in (linearised) dependency order


GHC.Prim        Has no implementation.  It defines built-in things, and
                by importing it you bring them into scope.
                The source file is GHC.Prim.hi-boot, which is just
                copied to make GHC.Prim.hi

GHC.Base        Classes: Eq, Ord, Functor, Monad
                Types:   list, (), Int, Bool, Ordering, Char, String

Data.Tuple      Types: tuples, plus instances for GHC.Base classes

GHC.Show        Class: Show, plus instances for GHC.Base/GHC.Tup types

GHC.Enum        Class: Enum,  plus instances for GHC.Base/GHC.Tup types

Data.Maybe      Type: Maybe, plus instances for GHC.Base classes

GHC.List        List functions

GHC.Num         Class: Num, plus instances for Int
                Type:  Integer, plus instances for all classes so far (Eq, Ord, Num, Show)

                Integer is needed here because it is mentioned in the signature
                of 'fromInteger' in class Num

GHC.Real        Classes: Real, Integral, Fractional, RealFrac
                         plus instances for Int, Integer
                Types:  Ratio, Rational
                        plus instances for classes so far

                Rational is needed here because it is mentioned in the signature
                of 'toRational' in class Real

GHC.ST  The ST monad, instances and a few helper functions

Ix              Classes: Ix, plus instances for Int, Bool, Char, Integer, Ordering, tuples

GHC.Arr         Types: Array, MutableArray, MutableVar

                Arrays are used by a function in GHC.Float

GHC.Float       Classes: Floating, RealFloat
                Types:   Float, Double, plus instances of all classes so far

                This module contains everything to do with floating point.
                It is a big module (900 lines)
                With a bit of luck, many modules can be compiled without ever reading GHC.Float.hi


Other Prelude modules are much easier with fewer complex dependencies.

Note [Depend on GHC.Integer]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Integer type is special because TidyPgm uses
GHC.Integer.Type.mkInteger to construct Integer literal values
Currently it reads the interface file whether or not the current
module *has* any Integer literals, so it's important that
GHC.Integer.Type (in package integer-gmp or integer-simple) is
compiled before any other module.  (There's a hack in GHC to disable
this for packages ghc-prim, integer-gmp, integer-simple, which aren't
allowed to contain any Integer literals.)

Likewise we implicitly need Integer when deriving things like Eq
instances.

The danger is that if the build system doesn't know about the dependency
on Integer, it'll compile some base module before GHC.Integer.Type,
resulting in:
  Failed to load interface for ‘GHC.Integer.Type’
    There are files missing in the ‘integer-gmp’ package,

Bottom line: we make GHC.Base depend on GHC.Integer; and everything
else either depends on GHC.Base, or does not have NoImplicitPrelude
(and hence depends on Prelude).

Note [Depend on GHC.Tuple]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Similarly, tuple syntax (or ()) creates an implicit dependency on
GHC.Tuple, so we use the same rule as for Integer --- see Note [Depend on
GHC.Integer] --- to explain this to the build system.  We make GHC.Base
depend on GHC.Tuple, and everything else depends on GHC.Base or Prelude.

Note: [List comprehensions and inlining]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The list monad operations are traditionally described in terms of concatMap:

xs >>= f = concatMap f xs

Similarly, mconcat for lists is just concat. Here in Base, however, we don't
have concatMap, and we'll refrain from adding it here so it won't have to be
hidden in imports. Instead, we use GHC's list comprehension desugaring
mechanism to define mconcat and the Applicative and Monad instances for lists.
We mark them INLINE because the inliner is not generally too keen to inline
build forms such as the ones these desugar to without our insistence.  Defining
these using list comprehensions instead of foldr has an additional potential
benefit, as described in compiler/deSugar/DsListComp.hs: if optimizations
needed to make foldr/build forms efficient are turned off, we'll get reasonably
efficient translations anyway.

monadic expressions.

Instances of 'Monad' should satisfy the following laws:

* @'return' a '>>=' k  =  k a@
* @m '>>=' 'return'  =  m@
* @m '>>=' (\\x -> k x '>>=' h)  =  (m '>>=' k) '>>=' h@

Furthermore, the 'Monad' and 'Applicative' operations should relate as follows:

* @'pure' = 'return'@
* @('<*>') = 'ap'@

The above laws imply:

* @'fmap' f xs  =  xs '>>=' 'return' . f@
* @('>>') = ('*>')@

and that 'pure' and ('<*>') satisfy the applicative functor laws.

The instances of 'Monad' for lists, 'Data.Maybe.Maybe' and 'System.IO.IO'
defined in the "Prelude" satisfy these laws.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original Applicative/Monad proposal stated that after
implementation, the designated implementation of (>>) would become

  (>>) :: forall a b. m a -> m b -> m b
  (>>) = (*>)

by default. You might be inclined to change this to reflect the stated
proposal, but you really shouldn't! Why? Because people tend to define
such instances the /other/ way around: in particular, it is perfectly
legitimate to define an instance of Applicative (*>) in terms of (>>),
which would lead to an infinite loop for the default implementation of
Monad! And people do this in the wild.

This turned into a nasty bug that was tricky to track down, and rather
than eliminate it everywhere upstream, it's easier to just retain the
original default.

Note: [sequence and mapM]

Originally, we defined

mapM f = sequence . map f

This relied on list fusion to produce efficient code for mapM, and led to
excessive allocation in cryptarithm2. Defining

sequence = mapM id

relies only on inlining a tiny function (id) and beta reduction, which tends to
be a more reliable aspect of simplification. Indeed, this does not lead to
similar problems in nofib.

{- Note [The rules for map]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rules for map work like this.

* Up to (but not including) phase 1, we use the "map" rule to
  rewrite all saturated applications of map with its build/fold
  form, hoping for fusion to happen.

  In phase 1 and 0, we switch off that rule, inline build, and
  switch on the "mapList" rule, which rewrites the foldr/mapFB
  thing back into plain map.

  It's important that these two rules aren't both active at once
  (along with build's unfolding) else we'd get an infinite loop
  in the rules.  Hence the activation control below.

* This same pattern is followed by many other functions:
  e.g. append, filter, iterate, repeat, etc. in GHC.List

  See also Note [Inline FB functions] in GHC.List

* The "mapFB" rule optimises compositions of map

* The "mapFB/id" rule gets rid of 'map id' calls.
  You might think that (mapFB c id) will turn into c simply
  when mapFB is inlined; but before that happens the "mapList"
  rule turns
     (foldr (mapFB (:) id) [] a
  back into
     map id
  Which is not very clever.

* Any similarity to the Functor laws for [] is expected.

Returns the 'tag' of a constructor application; this function is used
by the deriving code for Eq, Ord and Enum.

The primitive dataToTag# requires an evaluated constructor application
as its argument, so we provide getTag as a wrapper that performs the
evaluation before calling dataToTag#.  We could have dataToTag#
evaluate its argument, but we prefer to do it this way because (a)
dataToTag# can be an inline primop if it doesn't need to do any
evaluation, and (b) we want to expose the evaluation to the
simplifier, because it might be possible to eliminate the evaluation
in the case when the argument is already known to be evaluated.
