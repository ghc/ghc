-- This is a library of parser combinators, originally written by Koen Claessen.
-- It parses all alternatives in parallel, so it never keeps hold of
-- the beginning of the input string, a common source of space leaks with
-- other parsers.  The '(+++)' choice combinator is genuinely commutative;
-- it makes no difference which branch is \"shorter\".
