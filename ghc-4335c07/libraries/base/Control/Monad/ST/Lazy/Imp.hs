-- | The lazy state-transformer monad.
-- A computation of type @'ST' s a@ transforms an internal state indexed
-- by @s@, and returns a value of type @a@.
-- The @s@ parameter is either
--
-- * an uninstantiated type variable (inside invocations of 'runST'), or
--
-- * 'RealWorld' (inside invocations of 'stToIO').
--
-- It serves to keep the internal states of different invocations of
-- 'runST' separate from each other and from invocations of 'stToIO'.
--
-- The '>>=' and '>>' operations are not strict in the state.  For example,
--
-- @'runST' (writeSTRef _|_ v >>= readSTRef _|_ >> return 2) = 2@
newtype ST s a = ST { unST :: State s -> (a, State s) }

-- A lifted state token. This can be imagined as a moment in the timeline
-- of a lazy state thread. Forcing the token forces all delayed actions in
-- the thread up until that moment to be performed.
data State s = S# (State# s)

{- Note [Lazy ST and multithreading]

We used to imagine that passing a polymorphic state token was all that we
needed to keep state threads separate (see Launchbury and Peyton Jones, 1994:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/lazy-functional-state-threads/).
But this breaks down in the face of concurrency (see #11760). Whereas a strict
ST computation runs to completion before producing anything, a value produced
by running a lazy ST computation may contain a thunk that, when forced, will
lead to further stateful computations. If such a thunk is entered by more than
one thread, then they may both read from and write to the same references and
arrays, interfering with each other. To work around this, any time we lazily
suspend execution of a lazy ST computation, we bind the result pair to a
NOINLINE binding (ensuring that it is not duplicated) and calculate that
pair using (unsafePerformIO . evaluate), ensuring that only one thread will
enter the thunk. We still use lifted state tokens to actually drive execution,
so in these cases we effectively deal with *two* state tokens: the lifted
one we get from the previous computation, and the unlifted one we pull out of
thin air. -}

{- Note [Lazy ST: not producing lazy pairs]

The fixST and strictToLazyST functions used to construct functions that
produced lazy pairs. Why don't we need that laziness? The ST type is kept
abstract, so no one outside this module can ever get their hands on a (result,
State s) pair. We ourselves never match on such pairs when performing ST
computations unless we also force one of their components. So no one should be
able to detect the change. By refraining from producing such thunks (which
reference delayed ST computations), we avoid having to ask whether we have to
wrap them up with unsafePerformIO. See Note [Lazy ST and multithreading]. -}
