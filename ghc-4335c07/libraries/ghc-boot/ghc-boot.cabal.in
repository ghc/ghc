synopsis:       Shared functionality between GHC and its boot libraries
description:    This library is shared between GHC, ghc-pkg, and other boot
                libraries.
                .
                A note about "GHC.PackageDb": it only deals with the subset of
                the package database that the compiler cares about: modules
                paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors
                etc. It is thus not a library interface to ghc-pkg and is *not*
                suitable for modifying GHC package databases.
                .
                The package database format and this library are constructed in
                such a way that while ghc-pkg depends on Cabal, the GHC library
                and program do not have to depend on Cabal.
