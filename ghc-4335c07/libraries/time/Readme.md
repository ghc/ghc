# time

This is the haskell time library that is bundled with [GHC][GHC] the Glasgow/
Glorious Haskell compiler.

To build this package using Cabal directly from git, you must run
"autoreconf" before the usual Cabal build steps (configure/build/install).
autoreconf is included in the GNU autoconf tools.  There is no need to run
the "configure" script: the "setup configure" step will do this for you.
