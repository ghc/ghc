 Binary search over benchmark input sizes.

 There are many good ways to measure the time it takes to perform a
 certain computation on a certain input.  However, frequently, it's
 challenging to pick the right input size for all platforms and all
 compilataion modes.

 Sometimes for linear-complexity benchmarks it is better to measure
 /throughput/, i.e. elements processed per second.  That is, fixing
 the time of execution and measuring the amount of work done (rather
 than the reverse).  This library provides a simple way to search for
 an appropriate input size that results in the desired execution time.

 An alternative approach is to kill the computation after a certain
 amount of time and observe how much work it has completed.
