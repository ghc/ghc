Data Parallel Haskell Examples

 broken             
   Examples that have never worked, or don't anymore.

 examples/smoke
   Smoke tests are there to check that the library works, but no one would want
   the output. This is where we try to concatentate a random array and see what
   happens.

   examples/smoke/data     Test vectorisation of data types.
   examples/smoke/prims    Test functions in the lifted primitive library
   examples/smoke/sharing  Test for work complexity problems related to sharing.

 examples/imaginary
   Imaginary micro benchmarks compute a useful result, but not in a computationally
   relevant way. This inefficiency is good for stress testing DPH, but they are
   too slow to be useful in practice.

 examples/spectral
   Spectral benchmarks are kernels of real algorithms. They do something useful in
   a computatinally relevant way, but are not complete application programs.

 examples/real
   Real programs are the ones that might be used for some purpose other than
   testing DPH.
