Dot product
===========

DPH benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  DotPPrim.hs & prim.hs  -- using primitives of package dph directly
  DotPVect.hs & vect.hs  -- vectorised DPH code

Both benchmarks are compiled against both the seq and par flavour of 
package dph (with executables in the subdirectories seq/ and par/, 
respectively). 


Reference benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DotP.hs	      	       -- multi-threaded reference implementation in Haskell
dot-c.c		       -- multi-threaded reference implementation in C


Legacy code
~~~~~~~~~~~

The legacy/ directory has an old, sequential Haskell implementation of dot 
product timing a variety of Haskell arrays and a sequential C implementation.
