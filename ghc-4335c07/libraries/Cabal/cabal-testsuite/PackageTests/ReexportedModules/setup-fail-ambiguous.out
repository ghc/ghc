Error:
    Problem with module re-exports:
      - Ambiguous reexport 'Data.Map'
        It could refer to either:
             'containers-<VERSION>:Data.Map'
             brought into scope by build-depends: containers
          or 'containers-dupe-0.1.0.0:Data.Map'
             brought into scope by build-depends: containers-dupe
        The ambiguity can be resolved by qualifying the
        re-export with a package name.
        The syntax is 'packagename:ModuleName [as NewName]'.
