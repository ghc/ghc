Packages using 'cabal-version: >= 1.25' and the autogenerated module Paths_* must include it also on the 'autogen-modules' field besides 'exposed-modules' and 'other-modules'. This specifies that the module does not come with the package and is generated on setup. Modules built with a custom Setup.hs script also go here to ensure that commands like sdist don't fail.
The filename ./my.cabal does not match package name (expected: AutogenModules.cabal)
Note: the public hackage server would reject this package.
Warning: Cannot run preprocessors. Run 'configure' command first.
Building source dist for AutogenModules-0.1...
setup: Error: Could not find module: MyLibHelperModule with any suffix: ["gc","chs","hsc","x","y","ly","cpphs","hs","lhs","hsig","lhsig"]. If the module is autogenerated it should be added to 'autogen-modules'.
