Resolving dependencies...
Warning: solver failed to find a solution:
Could not resolve dependencies:
trying: Exe-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
unknown package: totally-impossible-dependency-to-fill (dependency of Exe)
fail (backjumping, conflict set: Exe, totally-impossible-dependency-to-fill)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: Exe (2), totally-impossible-dependency-to-fill (1)
Trying configure anyway.
