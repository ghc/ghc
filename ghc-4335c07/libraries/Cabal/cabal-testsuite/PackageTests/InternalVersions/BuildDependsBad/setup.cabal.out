Resolving dependencies...
Warning: solver failed to find a solution:
Could not resolve dependencies:
next goal: build-depends-bad-version (user goal)
rejecting: build-depends-bad-version-0.1.0.0 (conflict: build-depends-bad-version => build-depends-bad-version>=2)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: build-depends-bad-version (2)
Trying configure anyway.
Configuring build-depends-bad-version-0.1.0.0...
cabal: The package has an impossible version range for a dependency on an internal library: build-depends-bad-version >=2. This version range does not include the current package, and must be removed as the current package's library will always be used.
