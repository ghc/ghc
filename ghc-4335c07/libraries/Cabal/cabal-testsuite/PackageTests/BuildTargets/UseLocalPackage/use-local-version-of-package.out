cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
next goal: pkg (user goal)
rejecting: pkg-2.0 (constraint from user target requires ==1.0)
rejecting: pkg-1.0 (constraint from command line flag requires ==2.0)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: pkg (3)
