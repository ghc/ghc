Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
trying: pkg-1.0 (user goal)
next goal: setup-dep (user goal)
rejecting: setup-dep-2.0 (conflict: pkg => setup-dep==1.*)
rejecting: setup-dep-1.0 (constraint from user target requires ==2.0)
fail (backjumping, conflict set: pkg, setup-dep)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: setup-dep (3), pkg (2)
# pkg my-exe
Main.hs: setup-dep from repo
