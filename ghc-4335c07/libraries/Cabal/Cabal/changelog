	(#4724).
	* Added a new 'cabal check' warning about unused, undeclared or

	* Documentation fixes.

2.0.0.2 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> July 2017
	* See http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2017-09-09-Cabal-2-0.html
	for more detailed release notes.
	* The 2.0 migration guide gives advice on adapting Custom setup
	  scripts to backwards-incompatible changes in this release:
	  https://github.com/haskell/cabal/wiki/2.0-migration-guide
	* Add CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION to cabal_macros.h (#4319)
	* Dropped support for versions of GHC earlier than 6.12 (#3111).
	* GHC compatibility window for the Cabal library has been extended
	  to five years (#3838).
	* Convenience/internal libraries are now supported (#269).
	  An internal library is declared using the stanza "library
	  'libname'".  Packages which use internal libraries can
	  result in multiple registrations; thus '--gen-pkg-config'
	  can now output a directory of registration scripts rather than
	  a single file.
	* Backwards incompatible change to preprocessor interface:
	  the function in 'PPSuffixHandler' now takes an additional
	  'ComponentLocalBuildInfo' specifying the build information
	  of the component being preprocessed.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'cabal_macros.h' (#1893): we now
	  generate a macro file for each component which contains only
	  information about the direct dependencies of that component.
	  Consequently, 'dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h' contains
	  only the macros for the library, and is not generated if a
	  package has no library; to find the macros for an executable
	  named 'foobar', look in 'dist/build/foobar/autogen/cabal_macros.h'.
	  Similarly, if you used 'autogenModulesDir' you should now
	  use 'autogenComponentModulesDir', which now requires a
	  'ComponentLocalBuildInfo' argument as well in order to
	  disambiguate which component the autogenerated files are for.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'Component': 'TestSuite' and
	  'Benchmark' no longer have 'testEnabled' and
	  'benchmarkEnabled'.  If you used
	  'enabledTests' or 'enabledBenchmarks', please instead use
	  'enabledTestLBIs' and 'enabledBenchLBIs'
	  (you will need a 'LocalBuildInfo' for these functions.)
	  Additionally, the semantics of 'withTest' and 'withBench'
	  have changed: they now iterate over all buildable
	  such components, regardless of whether or not they have
	  been enabled; if you only want enabled components,
	  use 'withTestLBI' and 'withBenchLBI'.
	  'finalizePackageDescription' is deprecated:
	  its replacement 'finalizePD' now takes an extra argument
	  'ComponentRequestedSpec' which specifies what components
	  are to be enabled: use this instead of modifying the
	  'Component' in a 'GenericPackageDescription'.  (As
	  it's not possible now, 'finalizePackageDescription'
	  will assume tests/benchmarks are disabled.)
	  If you only need to test if a component is buildable
	  (i.e., it is marked buildable in the Cabal file)
	  use the new function 'componentBuildable'.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'PackageName' (#3896):
	  'PackageName' is now opaque; conversion to/from 'String' now works
	  via (old) 'unPackageName' and (new) 'mkPackageName' functions.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'ComponentId' (#3917):
	  'ComponentId' is now opaque; conversion to/from 'String' now works
	  via 'unComponentId' and 'mkComponentId' functions.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'AbiHash' (#3921):
	  'AbiHash' is now opaque; conversion to/from 'String' now works
	  via 'unAbiHash' and 'mkAbiHash' functions.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'FlagName' (#4062):
	  'FlagName' is now opaque; conversion to/from 'String' now works
	  via 'unFlagName' and 'mkFlagName' functions.
	* Backwards incompatible change to 'Version' (#3905):
	  Version is now opaque; conversion to/from '[Int]' now works
	  via 'versionNumbers' and 'mkVersion' functions.
	* Add support for `--allow-older` (dual to `--allow-newer`) (#3466)
	* Improved an error message for process output decoding errors
	(#3408).
	* 'getComponentLocalBuildInfo', 'withComponentsInBuildOrder'
	  and 'componentsInBuildOrder' are deprecated in favor of a
	  new interface in "Distribution.Types.LocalBuildInfo".
	* New 'autogen-modules' field. Modules that are built automatically at
	  setup, like Paths_PACKAGENAME or others created with a build-type
	  custom, appear on 'other-modules' for the Library, Executable,
	  Test-Suite or Benchmark stanzas or also on 'exposed-modules' for
	  libraries but are not really on the package when distributed. This
	  makes commands like sdist fail because the file is not found, so with
	  this new field modules that appear there are treated the same way as
	  Paths_PACKAGENAME was and there is no need to create complex build
	  hooks. Just add the module names on 'other-modules' and
	  'exposed-modules' as always and on the new 'autogen-modules' besides.
	(#3656).
	* New './Setup configure' flag '--cabal-file', allowing multiple
	.cabal files in a single directory (#3553). Primarily intended for
	internal use.
	* Macros in 'cabal_macros.h' are now ifndef'd, so that they
	don't cause an error if the macro is already defined. (#3041)
	* './Setup configure' now accepts a single argument specifying
	  the component to be configured.  The semantics of this mode
	  of operation are described in
	  <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/4>
	* Internal 'build-tools' dependencies are now added to PATH
	  upon invocation of GHC, so that they can be conveniently
	  used via `-pgmF`. (#1541)
	* Add support for new caret-style version range operator `^>=` (#3705)
	* Verbosity `-v` now takes an extended format which allows
	  specifying exactly what you want to be logged.  The format is
	  "[silent|normal|verbose|debug] flags", where flags is a space
	  separated list of flags. At the moment, only the flags
	  +callsite and +callstack are supported; these report the
	  call site/stack of a logging output respectively (these
	  are only supported if Cabal is built with GHC 8.0/7.10.2
	  or greater, respectively).
	* New `Distribution.Utils.ShortText.ShortText` type for representing
	  short text strings compactly (#3898)
	* Cabal no longer supports using a version bound to disambiguate
	  between an internal and external package (#4020).  This should
	  not affect many people, as this mode of use already did not
	  work with the dependency solver.
	* Support for "foreign libraries" (#2540), which are Haskell
	  libraries intended to be used by foreign languages like C.
	  Foreign libraries only work with GHC 7.8 and later.
	* Added a technical preview version of integrated doctest support (#4480).
	* Added a new 'scope' field to the executable stanza. Executables
	  with 'scope: private' get installed into
	  $libexecdir/$libexecsubdir. Additionally $libexecdir now has a
	  subdir structure similar to $lib(sub)dir to allow installing
	  private executables of different packages and package versions
	  alongside one another.  Private executables are those that are
	  expected to be run by other programs rather than users. (#3461)

0.4  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org> Sun Jan 16 2005

	* Much thanks to all the awesome fptools hackers who have been
	working hard to build the Haskell Cabal!

	* Interface Changes:

	** WARNING: this is a pre-release and the interfaces are still
	likely to change until we reach a 1.0 release.

	** Instead of Package.description, you should name your
	description files <something>.cabal.  In particular, we suggest
	that you name it <packagename>.cabal, but this is not enforced
	(yet).  Multiple .cabal files in the same directory is an error,
	at least for now.

	** ./setup install --install-prefix is gone.  Use ./setup copy
	--copy-prefix instead.

	** The "Modules" field is gone.  Use "hidden-modules",
	"exposed-modules", and "executable-modules".

	** Build-depends is now a package-only field, and can't go into
	executable stanzas.  Build-depends is a package-to-package
	relationship.

	** Some new fields.  Use the Source.

	* New Features

	** Cabal is now included as a package in the CVS version of
	fptools.  That means it'll be released as "-package Cabal" in
	future versions of the compilers, and if you are a bleeding-edge
	user, you can grab it from the CVS repository with the compilers.

	** Hugs compatibility and NHC98 compatibility should both be
	improved.

	** Hooks Interface / Autoconf compatibility: Most of the hooks
	interface is hidden for now, because it's not finalized.  I have
	exposed only "defaultMainWithHooks" and "defaultUserHooks".  This
	allows you to use a ./configure script to preprocess
	"foo.buildinfo", which gets merged with "foo.cabal".  In future
	releases, we'll expose UserHooks, but we're definitely going to
	change the interface to those.  The interface to the two functions
	I've exposed should stay the same, though.

	** ./setup haddock is a baby feature which pre-processes the
	source code with hscpp and runs haddock on it.  This is brand new
	and hardly tested, so you get to knock it around and see what you
	think.

	** Some commands now actually implement verbosity.

	** The preprocessors have been tested a bit more, and seem to work
	OK.  Please give feedback if you use these.

0.3  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org> Sun Jan 16 2005
	* Unstable snapshot release
	* From now on, stable releases are even.

0.2  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>

	* Adds more HUGS support and preprocessor support.
