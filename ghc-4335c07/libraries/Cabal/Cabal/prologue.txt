The Haskell Cabal is the Common Architecture for Building Applications
and Libraries.  It is a framework which defines a common interface for
authors to more easily build their applications in a portable way. The
Haskell Cabal is meant to be a part of a larger infrastructure for
distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell Libraries and
Tools. For more information, please see:
