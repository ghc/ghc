2.2.0.0 (current development version)
	* Completed the 'new-update' command (#4809), which respects nix-style
	cabal.project(.local) files and allows to update from
	multiple repositories when using overlays.
	* New config file field: 'cxx-options' to specify which options to be
	passed to the compiler when compiling C++ sources specified by the
	'cxx-sources' field. (#3700)
	* New config file field: 'cxx-sources' to specify C++ files to be
	compiled separately from C source files. Useful in conjunction with the
	'cxx-options' flag to pass different compiler options to C and C++
	source files. (#3700)
	* 'cabal configure' now supports '--enable-static' which can be
	used to build static libaries with GHC via GHC's `-staticlib` flag.
	* Don't automatically/silently case-correct mispelled package-names
	on CLI (#4778)
	* 'cabal update' now supports '--index-state' which can be used to
	roll back the index to an earlier state.
	* 'cabal new-configure' now backs up the old 'cabal.project.local'
	file if it exists (#4460).
	* Completed the 'new-run' command (#4477). The functionality is the
	same of the old 'run' command but using nix-style builds.
	Additionally, it can run executables across packages in a project.
	* Completed the 'new-bench' command (#3638). Same as above.
	* Completed the 'new-exec' command (#3638). Same as above.
	* Added a preliminary 'new-install' command (#4558, nonlocal exes
	part) which allows to quickly install executables from hackage.
	* '--allow-{newer,older}' syntax has been enhanced. Dependency
	relaxation can be now limited to a specific release of a package,
	plus there's a new syntax for relaxing only caret-style (i.e. '^>=')
	dependencies (#4575, #4669).
	* On macOS, `new-build` will now place dynamic libraries into
	`store/lib` and aggressively shorten their names in an effort to
	stay within the load command size limits of macOSs mach-o linker.
	* Use [lfxtb] letters to differentiate component kind instead of
	opaque "c" in dist-dir layout.

2.0.0.1 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> October 2017
	* Support for GHC's numeric -g debug levels (#4673).
	* Demoted 'scope' field version check to a warning (#4714).
	* Fixed verbosity flags getting removed before being passed to
	'printPlan' (#4724).
	* Added a '--store-dir' option that can be used to configure the
	location of the build global build store (#4623).
	* Turned `allow-{newer,older}` in `cabal.project` files into an
	accumulating field to match CLI flag semantics (#4679).
	* Improve success message when `cabal upload`ing documentation
	(#4777).
	* Documentation fixes.

2.0.0.0 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> August 2017
	* See http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2017-09-09-Cabal-2-0.html
	for more detailed release notes.
	* Removed the '--root-cmd' parameter of the 'install' command
	(#3356).
	* Deprecated 'cabal install --global' (#3356).
	* Changed 'cabal upload' to upload a package candidate by default
	(#3419). Same applies to uploading documentation.
	* Added a new 'cabal upload' flag '--publish' for publishing a
	package on Hackage instead of uploading a candidate (#3419).
	* Added optional solver output visualisation support via the
	tracetree package. Mainly intended for debugging (#3410).
	* Removed the '--check' option from 'cabal upload'
	(#1823). It was replaced by package candidates.
	* Fixed various behaviour differences between network transports
	(#3429).
	* The bootstrap script now works correctly when run from a Git
	clone (#3439).
	* Removed the top-down solver (#3598).
	* The '-v/--verbosity' option no longer affects GHC verbosity
	(except in the case of '-v0'). Use '--ghc-options=-v' to enable
	verbose GHC output (#3540, #3671).
	* Changed the default logfile template from
	'.../$pkgid.log' to '.../$compiler/$libname.log' (#3807).
	* Added a new command, 'cabal reconfigure', which re-runs 'configure'
	with the most recently used flags (#2214).
	* Added the '--index-state' flag for requesting a specific
	version of the package index (#3893, #4115).
	* Support for building Backpack packages.  See
	https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-proposals/blob/backpack/proposals/0000-backpack.rst
	for more details.
	* Support the Nix package manager (#3651).
	* Made the 'template-haskell' package non-upgradable again (#4185).
	* Fixed password echoing on MinTTY (#4128).
	* Added a new solver flag, '--allow-boot-library-installs', that allows
	any package to be installed or upgraded (#4209).
	* New 'cabal-install' command: 'outdated', for listing outdated
	version bounds in a .cabal file or a freeze file (#4207).
	* Added qualified constraints for setup dependencies. For example,
	--constraint="setup.bar == 1.0" constrains all setup dependencies on
	bar, and --constraint="foo:setup.bar == 1.0" constrains foo's setup
	dependency on bar (part of #3502).
	* Non-qualified constraints, such as --constraint="bar == 1.0", now
	only apply to top-level dependencies. They don't constrain setup or
	build-tool dependencies. The new syntax --constraint="any.bar == 1.0"
	constrains all uses of bar.
	* Added a technical preview version of the 'cabal doctest' command
	(#4480).

1.24.0.2 Mikhail Glushenkov <mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com> December 2016

	for packages with build-type: Custom and a custom-setup stanza
	(#3723).
	* 'cabal sdist' no longer ignores '--builddir' when the package's
	build-type is Custom (#3794).

	* Read 'builddir' option from 'CABAL_BUILDDIR' environment variable.

	https://example.com/foo-1.0.tar.gz'.
	* Automatically use https for cabal upload for the main
	hackage.haskell.org (other repos will use whatever they are
	configured to use).
	* Support for dependencies of custom Setup.hs scripts
	(see http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/cabal-setup-deps/).
	* 'cabal' program itself now can be used as an external setup
	method. This fixes an issue when Cabal version mismatch caused
	unnecessary reconfigures (#2633).
	* Improved error message for unsatisfiable package constraints
	(#2727).
	* Fixed a space leak in 'cabal update' (#2826).

	* The man page for 'cabal-install' is now automatically generated
	(#2877).
	* The '--allow-newer' option now works as expected when specified
	multiple times (#2588).
	* New config file field: 'extra-framework-dirs' (extra locations
	to find OS X frameworks in). Can be also specified as an argument
	for 'install' and 'configure' commands (#3158).
	* It's now possible to limit the scope of '--allow-newer' to
	single packages in the install plan (#2756).
	* Full '--allow-newer' syntax is now supported in the config file
	(that is, 'allow-newer: base, ghc-prim,  some-package:vector')
	(#3171).
	* Improved performance of '--reorder-goals' (#3208).
	* Fixed space leaks in modular solver (#2916, #2914).
	* Made the solver aware of pkg-config constraints (#3023).
