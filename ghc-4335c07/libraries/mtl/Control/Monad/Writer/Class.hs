-- tell is like tell on the MUD's it shouts to monad
-- what you want to be heard. The monad carries this 'packet'
-- upwards, merging it if needed (hence the Monoid requirement).
--
-- listen listens to a monad acting, and returns what the monad "said".
--
-- pass lets you provide a writer transformer which changes internals of
-- the written object.
