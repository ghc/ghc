/* Don't allow stage1 (cross-)compiler embed assumptions about target
 * platform. When ghc-stage1 is being built by ghc-stage0 is should not
 * refer to target defines. A few past examples:
 *  - https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/13491
 *  - https://phabricator.haskell.org/D3122
 *  - https://phabricator.haskell.org/D3405
 *
 * In those cases code change assumed target defines like SIZEOF_HSINT
 * are applied to host platform, not target platform.
 *
 * So what should be used instead in STAGE=1?
 *
 * To get host's equivalent of SIZEOF_HSINT you can use Bits instances:
 *    Data.Bits.finiteBitSize (0 :: Int)
 *
 * To get target's values it is preferred to use runtime target
 * configuration from 'targetPlatform :: DynFlags -> Platform'
 * record. A few wrappers are already defined and used throughout GHC:
 *    wORD_SIZE :: DynFlags -> Int
 *    wORD_SIZE dflags = pc_WORD_SIZE (sPlatformConstants (settings dflags))
 *
 * Hence we hide these macros from -DSTAGE=1

/* Sizes of C types come from here... */
#include "ghcautoconf.h"

/* Sizes of Haskell types follow.  These sizes correspond to:
 *   - the number of bytes in the primitive type (eg. Int#)
 *   - the number of bytes in the external representation (eg. HsInt)
 *   - the scale offset used by writeFooOffAddr#
 *
 * In the heap, the type may take up more space: eg. SIZEOF_INT8 == 1,
 * but it takes up SIZEOF_HSWORD (4 or 8) bytes in the heap.
