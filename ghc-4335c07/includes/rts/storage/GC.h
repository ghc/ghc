 * Generational GC
 *
 * We support an arbitrary number of generations.  Notes (in no particular
 * order):
 *
 *       - Objects "age" in the nursery for one GC cycle before being promoted
 *         to the next generation.  There is no aging in other generations.
 *
 *       - generation 0 is the allocation area.  It is given
 *         a fixed set of blocks during initialisation, and these blocks
 *         normally stay in G0S0.  In parallel execution, each
 *         Capability has its own nursery.
 *
 *       - during garbage collection, each generation which is an
 *         evacuation destination (i.e. all generations except G0) is
 *         allocated a to-space.  evacuated objects are allocated into
 *         the generation's to-space until GC is finished, when the
 *         original generations's contents may be freed and replaced
 *         by the to-space.
 *
 *       - the mutable-list is per-generation.  G0 doesn't have one
 *         (since every garbage collection collects at least G0).
 *
 *       - block descriptors contain a pointer to the generation that
 *         the block belongs to, for convenience.
 *
 *       - static objects are stored in per-generation lists.  See GC.c for
 *         details of how we collect CAFs in the generational scheme.
 *
 *       - large objects are per-generation, and are promoted in the
 *         same way as small objects.

// A count of blocks needs to store anything up to the size of memory

//    in Hp, outside Haskell it is stored in cap->r.rCurrentNursery->free.
//
//  - the blocks *after* cap->rCurrentNursery in the chain are empty
//    (although their bd->free pointers have not been updated to
//    reflect that)
//
//  - the blocks *before* cap->rCurrentNursery have been used.  Except
//    for rCurrentAlloc.

//  - cap->r.rCurrentAlloc is either NULL, or it points to a block in
