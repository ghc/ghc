# $1 = dir
# $2 = distdir
# $3 = depfile
# $4 = file
# $5 = ways
#
# The formatting of this definition (e.g. the blank line above) is
# important, in order to get make to generate the right makefile code.
#
# 's|\\|/|g'
#    We first normalise all slashes to be forward slashes. Note that
#    $(TOP) also uses forward slashes.
# 's| /$$| \\|'
#    But now we need to fix the line continuation characters that we
#    just broke.
# "1s|\.o|\.$($w_osuf)|"
#    We will have dependencies for .o files, so we need to fix them up
#    for the right object suffix for the way we're doing
# "1s|^|$(dir $4)|"
#    We always get deps for just foo.o when the file we're making is
#    a/b/c/foo.o, so we need to prepend the directory of the source file
# "1s|$1/|$1/$2/build/|"
#    Well, almost. We actually need to insert e.g. "dist/build" in the
#    middle of that directory
# "1s|$2/build/$2/build|$2/build|g"
#    But some source files, e.g. sm/Evac_thr.c, are also inside the
#    "dist/build" directory, so now we've just made
#    "dist/build/dist/build", so we need to remove the duplication
#    again
# "s|$(TOP)/||g$(CASE_INSENSITIVE_SED)"
#    Finally, when making deps for packages like ghc stage2, we have
#    some include paths for packages registered in the in-tree package
#    database. These include paths are full (i.e. not relative) paths,
#    which means that the "cpp -MM" output uses full paths in some cases.
#    This causes 2 problems:
#    * they don't match up with the rules to rebuild the files, where
#      appropriate.
#    * on Windows, make interprets the colon in c:/foo/bar.h as make
#      syntax.
#    So we sed off $(TOP). Unfortunately, on Windows, the case for the
#    drive letter is sometimes different in what $(TOP) starts with, and
#    what the path in the package database starts with. We therefore
#	 need to do the substitution case-insensitively on Windows. But
#    the s///i modifier isn't portable, so we set CASE_INSENSITIVE_SED
#    to "i" on Windows and "" on any other platform.

# We use this not only for .c files, but also for .S and .cmm files.
# As gcc doesn't know what a .cmm file is, it treats it as a linker
# input and ignores it. We therefore tell gcc that all files are C
# files with "-x c" so that it actually processes them all.
