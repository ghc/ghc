# Build a package with the stage-1 compiler, multiple ways.  A typical
# libraries/foo/ghc.mk will look like this:
#
# $(eval $(call build-package,libraries/base,dist-install))
#
# The package metadata is generated from the .cabal file and placed in
# package-data.mk.  It will look something like this:
#
# libraries/base_dist_MODULES = GHC.Base Data.Tuple ...
# libraries/base_dist_PACKAGE = base
# libraries/base_dist_VERSION = 4.0.0.0
# libraries/base_dist_HC_OPTS = -package ghc-prim-0.1.0.0 -XRank2Types ...
# libraries/base_dist_C_SRCS  = cbits/PrelIOUtils.c ...
# libraries/base_dist_S_SRCS  = cbits/foo.S ...
# libraries/base_dist_CC_OPTS = -Iinclude ...
# libraries/base_dist_LD_OPTS = -package ghc-prim-0.1.0.0
