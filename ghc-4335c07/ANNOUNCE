           ===============================================
            The Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 8.2.2
           ===============================================

The GHC Team is pleased to announce a new minor release of GHC. This release
builds on the performance and stability improvements of 8.2.1, fixing a variety
of correctness bugs, improving error messages, and making the compiler more
portable.

Notable bug-fixes include

 * A correctness issue resulting in segmentation faults in some
   FFI-users (#13707, #14346)

 * A correctness issue resulting in undefined behavior in some programs
   using STM (#14171)

 * A bug which may have manifested in segmentation faults in
   out-of-memory condition (#14329)

 * clearBit of Natural no longer bottoms (#13203)

 * A specialisation bug resulting in exponential blowup of compilation
   time in some specialisation-intensive programs (#14379)

 * ghc-pkg now works even in environments with misconfigured NFS mounts
   (#13945)

 * GHC again supports production of position-independent executables
   (#13702)

 * Better error messages around kind mismatches (#11198, #12373, #13530,
   #13610)

How to get it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release can be downloaded from

    https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_8_2_2.html

For older versions see

    https://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for many platforms, and the
source distribution is available from the same place.


Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Haskell is a standardized lazy functional programming language.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell. Included is an
optimising compiler generating efficient code for a variety of platforms,
together with an interactive system for convenient, quick development. The
distribution includes space and time profiling facilities, a large collection of
libraries, and support for various language extensions, including concurrency,
exceptions, and foreign language interfaces. GHC is distributed under a
BSD-style open source license.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references, contact
information, links to research groups) are available from the Haskell home page
(see below).
