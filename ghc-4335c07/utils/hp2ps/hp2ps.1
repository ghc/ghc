.TH HP2PS 1 "18 April 1992" 
.SH NAME
hp2ps \- convert a heap profile to a \*(PS graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hp2ps
[flags] [file][.hp] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B hp2ps
converts a heap profile stored in
.IR file
into a \*(PS graph, sending the result to
.IR file.ps.
By convention, files to be processed by 
.B hp2ps
have a 
.I .hp
extension. However, for compatibility with older versions of
.B hp2ps, 
this extension can be omitted. If 
.IR file
is omitted entirely, then the program behaves as a filter.
.SH OPTIONS
The flags are:
.IP "\fB\-d\fP"
In order to make graphs more readable,
.B hp2ps
sorts the shaded bands for each identifier. The default sort ordering is for
the bands with the largest area to be stacked on top of the smaller ones.
The
.B \-d
option causes rougher bands (those representing series of values with the
largest standard deviations) to be stacked on top of smoother ones.
.IP "\fB\-b\fP"
Normally,
.B hp2ps
puts the title of the graph in a small box at the top of the page. However, 
if the JOB string is too long to fit in a small box (more than 35 characters), 
then
.B hp2ps
will choose to use a big box instead. The
.B \-b
option forces
.B hp2ps
to use a big box.
.IP "\fB\-e\fP \fIfloat\fP[in|mm|pt]"
Generate encapsulated \*(PS suitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents.
Usually, the \*(PS graph is drawn in landscape mode in an area 
9 inches wide by 6 inches high, and
.B hp2ps
arranges for this area to be approximately centered on a sheet of a4
paper. This format is convenient of studying the graph in detail, but
it is unsuitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents. The 
.B \-e 
option causes the graph to be drawn in portrait mode, with 
.I float
specifying the width in inches, millimetres or points (the default).
The resulting \*(PS file conforms to the  
.I "Encapsulated Post Script"
(EPS) convention, and it can be included in a LaTeX document using Rokicki's 
dvi-to-\*(PS converter
.B dvips.
.B hp2ps
requires the width to exceed 2 inches.
.IP "\fB\-g\fP" 
Create output suitable for the
.B gs
\*(PS previewer (or similar). In this case the graph is printed in portrait
mode without scaling. The output is unsuitable for a laser printer.
.IP "\fB\-p\fP"
Use previous parameters. By default, the \*(PS graph is automatically
scaled both horizontally and vertically so that it fills the page.
However, when preparing a seires of graphs for use in a presentation, 
it is often useful to draw a new graph using the same scale, shading and
ordering as a previous one. The
.B \-p
flag causes the graph to be drawn using the parameters determined by
a previous run of 
.B hp2ps
on
.IR file.  
.IP "\fB\-s\fP"
Use a small box for the title.
.IP "\fB\-y\fP"
Draw the graph in the traditional York style, ignoring marks.
.IP "\fB\-c\fP"
Use colours in the rendering of the graphs.
.IP "\fB\-?\fP"
Print out usage information. 
.SH "INPUT FORMAT"
The format of a heap profile is best described by example:
