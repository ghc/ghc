When generating PostScript to show strings, '(' and ')' may need to be escaped. 
These characters are now escaped when the JOB string is shown.

2.

Manually deleting samples from a .hp file now does what you would expect.

The -t flag for setting the threshold percentage has been scrapped. No one

can be forced with -b and -s flag.

MARKS now print as small triangles which remain below the x axis.

6. 

There is an updated manual page.

7.

-m flag for setting maximum no of bands (default 20, cant be more than 20).
