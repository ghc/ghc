Synopsis: A utility for producing package metadata from Cabal package
          descriptions for GHC's build system
Description: This program is responsible for producing @package-data.mk@ files
             for Cabal packages. These files are used by GHC's @make@-based
             build system to determine the source files included by package,
             package dependencies, and other metadata.
