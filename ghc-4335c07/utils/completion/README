Glasgow Haskell Compiler Bash Completion
========================================

Depending on how you've installed GHC, there are different ways to turn
on the bash completion.  With a bit of luck, your OS distribution has already
setup everything and it's already working!  But since you're reading this file,
we assume that was not the case. Read on!


Option 1: Using your OS distribution's tools
--------------------------------------------

This should work if you installed GHC using the package manager of your *nix
distribution.  You need the 'bash-completion' package from your package manager
(likely already installed), and something like this in your ~/.bashrc file;

    if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
      . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
    elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . /etc/bash_completion
    fi

When you installed GHC using your OS distribution's package manager it should
have copied the bash completion file to the right directory.
Open a new terminal and try it out!


Option 2: Without OS distribution support
-----------------------------------------

Maybe your OS distribution doesn't support GHC's bash completion, maybe
you've installed your own build of GHC.  In either case, you can still have
bash completion!  You can even use GHC's bash completion without the
'bash-completion' package. Here are the steps;

 1) Copy the ghc.bash file somewhere (eg. ~/ghc.bash) or use it directly from
    the source directory.
 2) Add the following to your ~/.bashrc;

      source ~/ghc.bash

That's it!
