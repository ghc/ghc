# Note [Why build certain utils twice?]
#
# We build certain utils twice: once with stage0, and once with stage1.
# Examples are ghc-pkg and hsc2hs.
#
# These tools are needed during the bootstrapping process, so we have to use
# stage0 to build them at first (stage1 doesn't exist yet). (side note: they're
# also used later in the build process). We install them inplace.
#
# But we can't install these copies when you run 'make install'. The reason is
# that when DYNAMIC_GHC_PROGRAMS=YES, we want to install copies that are
# dynamically linked. But the stage0 copies are either statically linked, or
# linked against libraries on the build machine.
#
# Therefore we build fresh copies, using the stage1 compiler, and install them
# when you run 'make install'. They are not used for any other purpose.
