This "unlit" program, used by the GHC driver, is originally by Mark
Jones (then at Oxford).  It is taken in its present form *directly*
from the LML/HBC distribution (from Chalmers).

We are grateful for this piece of shared code.

For more "powerful" swizzling of literate scripts, please see the
"literate" stuff from Glasgow.
