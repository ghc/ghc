[All this] Works for
definition lists too.

    > nested
    > bird
    > tracks

    * Next list
    with more of the indented list content.

        Even more content on a new line.

        1. Different type of list

            (2) Deeper

            >>> Here's an example in a list
            example result

                    [b] Even deeper!
                    [c] No newline separation even in indented lists.
                    We can have any paragraph level element that we normally
                    can, like headers

                    === Level 3 header
                    with some contentâ€¦

      - list may start at arbitrary depth

      - and consecutive items at that depth
      belong to the same list

      - of course we can still

          * nest items like we are used to

      - and then get back to initial list
