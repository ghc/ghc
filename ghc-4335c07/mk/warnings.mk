# Note [Order of warning flags]
#
# In distdir-way-opts, build flags are added in the following order (this
# list is not exhaustive):
#
#   * SRC_HC_OPTS(_STAGE$4)
#   * ghc-options from .cabal files ($1_$2_HC_OPTS)
#   * SRC_HC_WARNING_OPTS(_STAGE$4)
#
# Considerations:
#
#   * Most .cabal files specify -Wall. But not all, and not all building we
#   do relies on .cabal files. So we have to add -Wall ourselves somewhere.
#
#   * Some .cabal also specify warning suppression flags. Because -Wall
#   overrides any warning suppression flags that come before it, we have to
#   make sure -Wall comes before any warning suppression flags. So we add it
#   to SRC_HC_OPTS.
#
#   * Similarly, our own warning suppression should come after the -Wall from
#   the .cabal files, so we do *not* add them to SRC_HC_OPTS.
